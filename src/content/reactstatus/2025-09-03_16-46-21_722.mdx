[React Server Components Support _Without_ a Framework?](https://react.statuscode.com/link/173697/5d0bbb4a61 "krasimirtsonev.com") — If you don’t want to use Next.js (or even the minimal [Waku](https://react.statuscode.com/link/173698/5d0bbb4a61) framework) but you want to play with React Server Components, this is for you. Krasimir built a tool to split code across the client/server divide so you can run RSCs without a framework.
