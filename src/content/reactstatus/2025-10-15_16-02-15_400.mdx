[React Compiler v1.0](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175666/5d0bbb4a61 "react.dev") — The [React Compiler](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175667/5d0bbb4a61) is now finally considered _stable_ and ready to take on some of your app’s optimization tasks by way of auto-memoization applied based on the compiler’s analysis of your code. You can still use `useMemo` and `useCallback` as appropriate for precise control, however.

[Next.js 16 Beta Released](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175683/5d0bbb4a61 "nextjs.org") — The popular framework takes a step into the future with Turbopack support now stable and the default bundler for new apps.
