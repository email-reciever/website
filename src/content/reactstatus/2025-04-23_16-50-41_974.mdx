[React Compiler Enters Release Candidate Stage](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168308/5d0bbb4a61 "react.dev") — With a plan [first unveiled in early 2024](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168309/5d0bbb4a61), React Compiler has been undergoing a _lot_ of development since and is now here in a ‘stable and near-final’ form, pending a final release in the coming months. The team has also been collaborating with the [`swc` project](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168310/5d0bbb4a61) and experimental `swc` support is included as part of this release.

[Impossible Components](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168312/5d0bbb4a61 "overreacted.io") — Dan Abramov continues with his series of ‘big picture’ posts with a look at the idea of so-called ‘impossible’ components that mix server-only and client-only features and how React Server Components can help bridge that divide, culminating in an example you can experiment with for yourself.
