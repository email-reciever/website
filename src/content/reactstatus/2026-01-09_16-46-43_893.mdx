[React Has Finally Solved Its Biggest Problem: The Joys of `useEffectEvent`](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179033/5d0bbb4a61 "blog.logrocket.com") — You might be more used to seeing Jack on YouTube, but he writes too! Here, he looks at how React 19.2’s `useEffectEvent` hook can help solve the stale closure problem that has plagued `useEffect` for years.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   If you attended React Conf 2025, either in person or virtually, [the team is seeking your feedback](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179034/5d0bbb4a61) for making future events even better.
    
*   ⚠️ [The React Router team has just published six CVEs](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179035/5d0bbb4a61) identifying security vulnerabilities in React Router and Remix v2. Upgrading is advised.
    
*   Dan Abramov released [RSC Explorer](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179036/5d0bbb4a61) as an aid for understanding how React Server Components operate behind the scenes.
    
*   A developer shows off [▶️ a demo of his React Native decompiler and disassembly tool.](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179037/5d0bbb4a61)
    

[React Has Changed, Your Hooks Should Too](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179038/5d0bbb4a61 "allthingssmitty.com") — _“If you’re still writing Hooks the same way you did in 2020, that’s fine. Most of us are. But React 18+ gives us a much better toolbox, and getting comfortable with these patterns pays off quickly.”_
