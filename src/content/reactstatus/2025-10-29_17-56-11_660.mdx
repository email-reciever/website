🫢 Unfortunately I forgot to mention it in the [last issue](https://react.statuscode.com/issues/448), but last week was a scheduled break, so you didn't miss anything – we're now back each week until the Christmas break in December! :-)

[Directives and the Platform Boundary](https://react.statuscode.com/link/176245/5d0bbb4a61 "tanstack.com") — First there was the `"use strict"` directive to opt in to strict mode in JavaScript, but now you’ll encounter `use client`, `use server`, `use no memo`, and more, despite not being standard JS features at all. Tanner thinks this proliferation of directives comes at a cost and a risk of framework and tooling lock-in.

Tanner Linsley (TanStack)

**IN BRIEF:**

*   🤔 [`use no memo`](https://react.statuscode.com/link/176246/5d0bbb4a61) is a new React directive to prevent a function from being optimized by [React Compiler.](https://react.statuscode.com/link/176247/5d0bbb4a61)
    
*   📱 Loren Stewart [built the same app ten different times](https://react.statuscode.com/link/176248/5d0bbb4a61) to compare the performance differences between approaches (including two React-based ones) on mobile devices in particular.
    
*   On _X_, Tzvetan Milkov [showed off an interesting proof of concept](https://react.statuscode.com/link/176249/5d0bbb4a61) of React driving the [Dear ImGui](https://react.statuscode.com/link/176250/5d0bbb4a61) GUI library with the [Hermes](https://react.statuscode.com/link/176251/5d0bbb4a61) JS engine as an alternative way to create native apps.
    

[How to Fix Any Bug](https://react.statuscode.com/link/176252/5d0bbb4a61 "overreacted.io") — Dan Abramov ran into a bug when working with React Router and AI failed to solve it. Why? It didn’t have a good ‘repro’ to work with – that is, a set of instructions and the simplest code needed to _reproduce_ the bug. Dan explains the importance of such repros when finding bugs and what his bug ultimately turned out to be.
