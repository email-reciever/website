[The _State of React 2024_ Survey Results](https://react.statuscode.com/link/165599/5d0bbb4a61 "2024.stateofreact.com") — There’s too much to go into depth here, so enjoy having a browse through insights gleaned from almost 8,000 responses. We get to learn that `forwardRef` and `memo` are the two top ‘pain points’ among React devs, Redux continues to lead amongst state management libraries, and SPAs continue to make up the majority of React use cases for now.

[Why I Rebuilt ProseMirror’s Renderer in React](https://react.statuscode.com/link/165601/5d0bbb4a61 "smoores.dev") — A former engineer for the New York Times unpacks years of work on integrating React with [ProseMirror](https://react.statuscode.com/link/165602/5d0bbb4a61), a toolkit for building rich text editors which notoriously does not ‘play nicely’ with React. A great look into the details of the challenges involved.
