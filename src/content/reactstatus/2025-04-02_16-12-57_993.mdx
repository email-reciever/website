[React 19.1 Released](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167607/5d0bbb4a61 "github.com") — Not cool enough to get a full blog post on the official blog, but 19.1 brings a lot to the table in terms of fixes, small additions (e.g. support for streaming in edge environments), a [new API for prerendering RSCs on the server](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167608/5d0bbb4a61) (as supported in [Parcel 2.14.0](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167609/5d0bbb4a61)), and enhanced Suspense support. The headline feature, though, is ‘Owner Stacks’, a development-only feature for more easily tracking which components are responsible for rendering other components.

[JavaScript's Missing Link: Wasp Offers Full Stack Solution](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167610/5d0bbb4a61 "thenewstack.io") — A nice overview of what the [Wasp](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167611/5d0bbb4a61) team is trying to do in building a full-stack webapp framework around React, Node, and Prisma. It’s an increasingly powerful option if you’re looking for a more traditionally feeling full-stack approach.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   🤡 Vercel's Guillermo Rauch [attempted a React April Fools' joke on X yesterday](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167612/5d0bbb4a61) saying React will switch from `className` to `class`. Sadly, it's not true, and [he gives some background](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167613/5d0bbb4a61) as to why that's the case.
    
*   [CVE-2025-31137](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167614/5d0bbb4a61) is the identifier for a vulnerability in Remix/React Router that affects Remix 2 and React Router 7 consumers using the Express adapter.
    
*   The [Remotion](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167615/5d0bbb4a61) React-to-video toolkit has added a neat [audiogram template](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167616/5d0bbb4a61) for rendering waveform-style views of audio-oriented media.

[TinyBase v6.0: A Reactive Data Store for Local-First Apps](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167624/5d0bbb4a61 "tinybase.org") — We’re huge fans of this powerful reactive data store that can be used as the entire backend for many types of app. v6.0 adds no new functionality but brings React 19 support and goes ESM-only. It’s well worth investigating and has some compelling features - check out [the homepage](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167625/5d0bbb4a61) for more.

💡 Of course, React isn't _necessary_ to do this, as Paul Irish shows in [this CodePen](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167630/5d0bbb4a61) of making an SVG interactive with just CSS.
