[The Mega April _React Labs_ Update](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168580/5d0bbb4a61 "react.dev") — Every once in a while, the React team drops a ‘Labs’ post where they bring us up to speed with some major new features and what the team is working on. Here, we learn about two new features ready to try out today in `react@experimental`: View Transitions and the `&lt;Activity>` component. There are [several other features in development too.](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168581/5d0bbb4a61)

Ricky Hanlon

💡 For more on these features, dev YouTuber Theo Browne [▶️ dropped a 40-minute video](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168582/5d0bbb4a61) walking through the entire post and its implications. Meanwhile, Jack Whiting shared [a practical example of getting view transitions working](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168583/5d0bbb4a61) in a Next.js app.

[What Does `'use client'` Do?](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168584/5d0bbb4a61 "overreacted.io") — Dan continues his recent stream of insightful posts with a shorter, more practical look at how to think about the `use client` and `use server` directives React Server Components introduced and how they let you elegantly structure a client/server app as _“a single program spanning two environments”_ – a concept that Dan thinks could easily outlive React and be useful elsewhere too.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   🕹️ The [React Jam game dev event](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168585/5d0bbb4a61) is back for its sixth run next month, giving you the chance to build a React-powered game in ten days with the potential for getting some exposure/players and possibly even a prize..
