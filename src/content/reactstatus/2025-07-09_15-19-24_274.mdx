**IN BRIEF:**

*   [TypeScript 5.9 Beta](https://react.statuscode.com/link/171501/5d0bbb4a61) has been released.
    
*   [Nuxt](https://react.statuscode.com/link/171502/5d0bbb4a61) is to Vue.js as Next.js to React, so it's interesting to see [Vercel has acquired NuxtLabs](https://react.statuscode.com/link/171503/5d0bbb4a61), the company directly maintaining Nuxt. This means Nuxt, Next.js, _and_ Svelte now all have close ties with Vercel. Vue's creator [Evan You is optimistic about this development.](https://react.statuscode.com/link/171504/5d0bbb4a61)
    
*   [A comparison of data egress costs](https://react.statuscode.com/link/171505/5d0bbb4a61) from about 40 popular providers and cloud services, including Vercel, AWS, Fly and Linode.

[The Story of Patreon’s Internationalization Overhaul](https://react.statuscode.com/link/171507/5d0bbb4a61 "www.patreon.com") — Content creator monetization platform Patreon had its own homegrown legacy i18n library for its React-based frontend, but overhauled it with a more modern (though unnamed) approach using codemods. The tale is told in an interesting way.

[Building a Lightweight Reactive State Manager with ES6 Proxies](https://react.statuscode.com/link/171508/5d0bbb4a61 "www.lorenstew.art") — What if you didn’t _need_ a library for reactive state management? An interesting exploration of a built-in JavaScript mechanism for reacting to state changes. React doesn't use this approach under the hood (though Vue 3 does) but it's worth understanding.
