[Gemini: Google's AI App Adds 'Canvas' Mode for React Devs](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167286/5d0bbb4a61 "gemini.google.com") — _Gemini_ is essentially Google’s answer to ChatGPT and now has a developer ‘canvas’ mode which can be used to create, iterate, and preview React and HTML code right in the browser. It’s free at a basic level, too, so if you have a Google account, you should get straight in.

[Next.js 15.2.3 Released Due to Security Vulnerability](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167287/5d0bbb4a61 "socket.dev") — This past weekend, a new version of Next.js was released to resolve a serious security vulnerability, which could allow the skipping of middleware (including that used for authentication). Self-hosted Next.js deployments need to be upgraded _immediately_. The news led to a lot of responses from [extensive HN threads](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167288/5d0bbb4a61) to [deep dives into the vulnerability](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167289/5d0bbb4a61), and [criticism of how it was all handled.](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167290/5d0bbb4a61)

Lee Robinson (Vercel)

💡 Vercel also followed up with [a postmortem on the middleware bypass](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167291/5d0bbb4a61), what they did, and what they're planning to do next.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   🎂 [Over on X,](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167292/5d0bbb4a61) Sebastien Lorber noticed that React Native just turned ten years old yesterday.
    
*   [Rsdoctor 1.0 has been released](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167293/5d0bbb4a61). It's a build analyzer tailored for the Rspack ecosystem but fully compatible with the webpack ecosystem.
    

▶  [React Query API Design: Lessons Learned](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167294/5d0bbb4a61 "www.youtube.com") — You might know Dominik for all his work on React Query, TanStack Router, and his epic [React Query - The Bad Parts](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167295/5d0bbb4a61) series. Here, he walks us through the design choices made while building React Query and shares lessons and mistakes valuable to anyone building their own libraries. _(30 minutes.)_
