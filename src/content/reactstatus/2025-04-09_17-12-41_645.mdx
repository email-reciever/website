[React for Two Computers](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167855/5d0bbb4a61 "overreacted.io") — Dan Abramov returns to some deep thoughts that arose while putting together the popular [▶️ React for Two Computers talk](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167856/5d0bbb4a61) he gave at React Conf 2024. You’ll need a _very_ large coffee to make it through this post in one sitting, but it’s a technically-rich meditation on the architecture and theory underpinning ideas like React Server Components.

[React Reconciliation: The Hidden Engine Behind Your Components](https://react.statuscode.com/link/167858/5d0bbb4a61 "cekrem.github.io") — React’s reconciliation algorithm is the process by which React knows how to update the DOM based on changes to the virtual DOM and understanding how it works is essential for producing fast, efficient apps. A great look behind the scenes.
