▶  [Innovating React with Ricky Hanlon](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175003/5d0bbb4a61 "www.youtube.com") — React core team member Ricky Hanlon joins Ryan Carniato (known for [SolidJS](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175004/5d0bbb4a61)) to discuss all manner of things from how Ryan joined the team and how the React team works, to the pros and cons of `useEffect`, before moving on to hours of live development, demos, and more. It’s _six hours long_ but it’s timestamped so you can focus on what interests you most.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   The latest [State of JS survey is now open](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175005/5d0bbb4a61) to take.
    
*   If, for some reason, you're considering [moving a Vercel hosted app to Cloudflare Pages](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175006/5d0bbb4a61), here's how to do it (there's also [one for Netlify](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175007/5d0bbb4a61), if you prefer). [Dan Abramov says](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175008/5d0bbb4a61) that deployment adapters in Next.js 16+ will make this sort of migration even easier.
    
*   [Astro 5.14 has been released](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175009/5d0bbb4a61) and [adds support](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175010/5d0bbb4a61) for using React 19 action states.

Here’s how he migrated from a TanStack Router-based SPA to TanStack Start ([v1 of which](https://react.statuscode.com/link/175012/5d0bbb4a61) is now in release candidate stage).
