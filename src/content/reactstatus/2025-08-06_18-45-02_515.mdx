["JavaScript Isn’t the Problem, Replacing the Browser Was"](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172779/5d0bbb4a61 "rwsdk.com") — The creator of [RedwoodSDK](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172780/5d0bbb4a61), now pitching itself as a React framework for building server-side apps on Cloudflare, suggests SPA-style development was a compromise to work around platform limitations, but now a server-first approach makes good sense.

[Building a Full-Stack App with React and Aspire](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172781/5d0bbb4a61 "devblogs.microsoft.com") — [Aspire](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172782/5d0bbb4a61) is a .NET-based toolchain for building distributed apps, and this is a walkthrough of using it to build a C#-backed React app.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [TypeScript 5.9 has been released](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172783/5d0bbb4a61) – it's a relatively gentle release, but there is now [support for `import defer`](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172784/5d0bbb4a61), as well as 'expandable hovers' in editors like VS Code to see expanded type information.
    
*   ⭐ Last week, we mentioned Jack Herrington's [▶️ Zod vs Valibot battle](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172785/5d0bbb4a61) – he's back with a new heads-up, [▶️ pitching tRPC against oRPC in a type-safe API battle.](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172786/5d0bbb4a61)
    
*   [Vercel has unveiled AI SDK 5](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172787/5d0bbb4a61), the latest version of its AI app toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript.
    
*   Minimal React framework [Waku has adopted Vite's official RSC plugin `@vitejs/plugin-rsc`.](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172788/5d0bbb4a61)
    
*   A curious attempt to [reproduce the macOS UI with React](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172789/5d0bbb4a61) ([code](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172790/5d0bbb4a61)).
    

[Unlocking Web Workers with React: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172791/5d0bbb4a61 "www.rahuljuliato.com") — [Web Workers](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172792/5d0bbb4a61) provide a way to run certain code in background threads, rather than blocking things on the main thread. This adds some complexity and isn’t always a best first step, but it’s worth knowing how it works.

*   [There's a quick update of 'what's new in ViteLand'](https://react.statuscode.com/link/172812/5d0bbb4a61), including Vite 7.0, Rolldown improvements, Oxlint, Vitest, and other tools in the Vite space.
