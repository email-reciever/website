[React Still Feels.. Foolish, and No One is Talking About It?](https://react.statuscode.com/link/171154/5d0bbb4a61 "mbrizic.com") — We wouldn’t normally feature such a provocative piece, but the React blogosphere has been _very_ slow this week and the discussions around this article have been substantial enough (on [both Reddit](https://react.statuscode.com/link/171155/5d0bbb4a61) and [Hacker News](https://react.statuscode.com/link/171156/5d0bbb4a61)) that we’re giving it a chance. Mario illuminates some pain points around complexity in modern, rich SPA apps and how the flexibility of libraries like React can quickly lead to a convoluted mess if you’re not careful.

😅 Now, can we please get a flood of positive articles in the other direction to feature?

✂︎  Deep cuts from the queue

As it's a quieter week than usual, we've gone back to look through our ever-growing queue of items which haven't yet made it into the newsletter for one reason or another. Here are some of the things that jumped out:

😎 Did You Know..?

As much as we enjoy making this newsletter, we also publish a handful of others you might not know about. You can see the latest issues of them all directly on their homepages:
