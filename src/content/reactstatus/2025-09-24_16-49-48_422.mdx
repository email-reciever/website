[TanStack Start v1 Release Candidate](https://react.statuscode.com/link/174676/5d0bbb4a61 "tanstack.com") — First appearing on our radar a year ago, TanStack’s attempt at a full-stack TanStack Router-powered framework has reached a v1.0 release candidate that’s expected to be largely the same as its eventual 1.0 release. We’ll let it sell itself: _“it’s the next chapter in building type-safe, high-performance React apps without the heavy abstractions.”_

[Middleware Now Stable in React Router](https://react.statuscode.com/link/174677/5d0bbb4a61 "remix.run") — The middleware feature is now stable in [React Router](https://react.statuscode.com/link/174678/5d0bbb4a61) 7.9.0 via the `future.v8_middleware` flag. Here’s a look at the problems it can solve, and the patterns it unlocks.

API keys make this hard by breaking user flows and lacking scope. WorkOS Connect implements all five OAuth 2.1 specs in one drop-in API for secure, delegated access.
