Remotion Releases Agent Skill for Creating Videos

[Remotion](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179772/5d0bbb4a61) is a toolkit for creating videos with React that's been around for several years. You compose elements with React and render MP4s of the results. The only issue is, it takes a lot of skill (and code) to make something good.

A few days ago, the Remotion team launched ([on X](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179773/5d0bbb4a61)) a set of 'agent skills' ([read them here](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179774/5d0bbb4a61)) for tools like _Claude Code_ to create high-quality videos with prompting alone. As an example, [here's a log of the session used](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179775/5d0bbb4a61) to create Remotion's own promo video for the feature.

Remotion's post got _ten million_ impressions, and people are generating videos en masse. I've created a few and am impressed by the potential. Several YouTubers have [▶️ created videos](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179776/5d0bbb4a61) [▶️ showing off what they've made](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179777/5d0bbb4a61) and [▶️ sharing advice](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179778/5d0bbb4a61). _(If you use X, [search for 'remotion'](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179779/5d0bbb4a61) and you'll be flooded with examples.)_

And even if AI isn't your thing, Remotion is still worth [checking out.](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179772/5d0bbb4a61)

[The Incredible Overcomplexity of the Shadcn Radio Button](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179736/5d0bbb4a61 "paulmakeswebsites.com") — A radio button is just a radio button, right? _No_. Paul digs into the complexity UI frameworks can often introduce in the name of accessibility and consistent cross-browser behavior. This provoked a lot of discussion on social media and [Hacker News](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179737/5d0bbb4a61), where Dan Abramov popped in to make some points.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   🇫🇷 [React Paris](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179738/5d0bbb4a61) is taking place this March 26-27 in Paris, France — though you can also attend virtually.

*   A developer floats the idea of [putting inline assertions into your React code](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179741/5d0bbb4a61), rather than having separate tests.
