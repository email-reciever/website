[Redux's Maintainer on the State of React and the Community in 2025](https://react.statuscode.com/link/170598/5d0bbb4a61 "blog.isquaredsoftware.com") — React remains dominant but version 19’s features and changes have rekindled debate over React’s future. Redux lead Mark Erikson chronicles React’s evolution, the growing split between Meta’s internal-driven process and Vercel’s Next‑led Server Components work, the docs’ references to frameworks, and pushes back on the FUD about Vercel “taking over,” “React only works with Next” myths, and fears of client‑side abandonment.
