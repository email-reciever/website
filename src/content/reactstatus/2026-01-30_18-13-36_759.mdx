[The Engineering Behind GitHub Copilot CLI’s Animated ASCII Banner](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180068/5d0bbb4a61 "github.blog") — GitHub’s [Copilot CLI](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180069/5d0bbb4a61) tool is built, like many terminal-based coding agents, around [Ink](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180070/5d0bbb4a61), a React-powered TUI renderer. The team explains how they integrated a fancy animation into that app and, as a byproduct, GitHub's animator Cameron Foxly created [ASCII Motion](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180071/5d0bbb4a61), a Web-based ASCII art animation tool (which is [an open source React app](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180109/5d0bbb4a61) too).

⚠️ [More DoS Fixes for Server Components Arrive in React 19.2.4, 19.1.5, and 19.0.4](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180072/5d0bbb4a61 "github.com") — _"It was found that the fixes to address DoS in React Server Components were incomplete and we found multiple denial of service vulnerabilities still exist in React Server Components."_

React Team

💡 In related security news, Vercel summarizes [two DoS vulnerabilities found that affect self-hosted Next.js apps](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180073/5d0bbb4a61), fixed in Next.js 15.5.10, 15.6.0-canary.61, 16.1.5 and 16.2.0-canary.8.

[JavaScript Frameworks – Heading into 2026](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180074/5d0bbb4a61 "dev.to") — Every year, [SolidJS](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180075/5d0bbb4a61) creator Ryan Carniato takes stock of the JavaScript framework landscape. Saying we're in _"an incredibly exciting time"_, he breaks things down across several areas of development. The momentum he's tracking is hard to ignore.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   Over on Reddit's `/r/reactjs`, a developer shares [their excitement at a 'night and day' change in performance](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180076/5d0bbb4a61) when using React Compiler.
    
*   Reddit hosted a discussion on choosing [TanStack Start vs React Router vs Next.js](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180077/5d0bbb4a61) with TanStack picking up the most eager recommendations, with one commenter noting _"John Resig said tanstack was awesome. That's a great endorsement."_ 😁
    
*   The [beta period for Expo SDK 55](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180078/5d0bbb4a61) is in full swing. The beta uses React Native 0.83.1 and React 19.2.0 and your apps can now opt in to use Hermes v1.

🤖 [Vercel Finds `AGENTS.md` Outperforms Skills in Evals](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180080/5d0bbb4a61 "vercel.com") — Vercel has been doing a lot of research into agentic development recently (releasing its [React Best Practices skills](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180081/5d0bbb4a61) just recently). But in its latest evals targeting Next.js 16 development, it found jamming an 8KB docs index into an `AGENTS.md` file did a better job due to skills not being reliably triggered.

[Facehash: Unique Minimalist User Avatar Component](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180086/5d0bbb4a61 "www.facehash.dev") — Not all of your users will upload an avatar, so Facehash can stand in where a blank icon might fall flat. This component gives you subtle, yet characterful, automatic avatars, and can also work as a fallback for when a user's own avatar doesn’t load.
