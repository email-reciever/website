[_Wake Up, Remix!_ Everything's Changing..](https://react.statuscode.com/link/170305/5d0bbb4a61 "remix.run") — A year ago, [Remix and React Router merged together](https://react.statuscode.com/link/170306/5d0bbb4a61) reflecting their shared goals and code, but now it’s _all change_ again. [React Router](https://react.statuscode.com/link/170307/5d0bbb4a61) is now basically what Remix originally intended to be, so Remix is ‘rebooting’ as a model-first, low-dependency, Web API-centric full-stack framework built on [Preact](https://react.statuscode.com/link/170308/5d0bbb4a61).
