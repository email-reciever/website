*   [ESLint v10.0 is out](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180744/5d0bbb4a61) and now tracks JSX references, enabling correct scope analysis of JSX elements.

*   ✏️ Rick Hanlon is [working on an extensive rewrite](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180747/5d0bbb4a61) of the `useActionState` docs. You can [see an early draft here.](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180748/5d0bbb4a61)
    

[React Native 0.84: Now Hermes V1 by Default](https://react.statuscode.com/link/180749/5d0bbb4a61 "reactnative.dev") — Hermes V1 is now the default JS engine on iOS and Android, improving performance and reducing memory usage. iOS ships with precompiled binaries, cutting build times. Under the hood, everything now runs on React 19.2.3.
