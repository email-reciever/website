**IN BRIEF:**

*   An anonymous Reddit user [shares the process a 'big tech company' used](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168924/5d0bbb4a61) in their hiring process for a React developer.

[React Server Components for Astro Developers](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168927/5d0bbb4a61 "overreacted.io") — [Astro](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168928/5d0bbb4a61)’s ‘island’ architecture and React Server Components share a strikingly similar mental model. Dan compares the two, digs into some of the quirks, and suggests Astro might be a ‘gentler onramp’ to some of RSC’s ideas if you’re struggling with them.
