[Introducing: React Best Practices](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179398/5d0bbb4a61 "vercel.com") — The Vercel team has boiled down _“10+ years of React and Next.js optimization knowledge”_ into [a suite of Markdown files](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179399/5d0bbb4a61) intended for use by coding agents like Claude Code and [OpenCode](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179400/5d0bbb4a61), though you can just as easily read them yourself. The goal is to allow such agents to write better React code without needless handholding.

⚠️ [Node.js Fixes `AsyncLocalStorage` Crash Bug That Could Take Down Production Servers](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179403/5d0bbb4a61 "socket.dev") — In a collection of [January 13 security releases](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179404/5d0bbb4a61), Node.js mitigated a bug where processes could spontaneously terminate in an uncatchable fashion, something that can impact apps built with, among others, Next.js, React Server Components, or using APM tools.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   Microsoft's [_Aspire_](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179405/5d0bbb4a61) app orchestration framework now [treats JavaScript as a first-class citizen](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179406/5d0bbb4a61) meaning you can now use it to build and deploy full React apps, complete with Vite.
    
*   [The company behind the _Astro_ web framework has been acquired by Cloudflare](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179407/5d0bbb4a61) – [Astro 6 beta](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179408/5d0bbb4a61) has also just been released.
    
*   Cursor, the popular agent-based development tool, [slipped a note into a recent developer log](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179409/5d0bbb4a61) that it's experimenting with a migration from Solid to React and may make the switch in a future release.
    
*   [An interview with David Haz](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179410/5d0bbb4a61), the creator of [React Bits](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179411/5d0bbb4a61), a suite of animation-focused components.
    

[`useOptimistic` Won't Save You](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179412/5d0bbb4a61 "www.columkelly.com") — React 19’s [useOptimistic](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179413/5d0bbb4a61) hook is supposed to make optimistic UI updates simple, but in this detailed walkthrough, Colum shows that many problems still lurk. His takeaway: these APIs are designed for framework authors, and the rest of us should probably let our frameworks handle the complexity.

[Building Type-Safe Compound Components](https://react.statuscode.com/link/179414/5d0bbb4a61 "tkdodo.eu") — _“I think compound components are a really good design-pattern when building component libraries. They give consumers flexibility in how components are composed, without forcing every variation into a single, prop-heavy API.”_
