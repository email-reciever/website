**IN BRIEF:**

*   Over on Reddit, [an interesting discussion has broken out](https://react.statuscode.com/link/164986/5d0bbb4a61) about React Router v7 and that the Remix/React Router 'merge' is having a negative impact on developers.
    
*   📊 [Vercel has acquired the team](https://react.statuscode.com/link/165011/5d0bbb4a61) behind [Tremor](https://react.statuscode.com/link/165012/5d0bbb4a61), a popular suite of React components for building charts and dashboards. The plan is to enhance [v0](https://react.statuscode.com/link/165013/5d0bbb4a61) with Tremor's work and to open-source more components.
    
*   Over on X, the former CTO of Shopify [reflected on the complexities of the decision to go 'all in' on React Native](https://react.statuscode.com/link/165020/5d0bbb4a61) in response to [Shopify's article last week.](https://react.statuscode.com/link/165021/5d0bbb4a61)
    
*   Also on X, Vercel's Guillermo Rauch [observes that 'React has become the 'Linux kernel' of modern software development.'](https://react.statuscode.com/link/165030/5d0bbb4a61).
