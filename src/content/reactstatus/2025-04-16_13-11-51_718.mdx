🥚 We're taking a little break for Easter but didn't want to take the _entire_ week off, so we have a slimline issue for you today :-) Back to full Dev Mode™ next Wednesday!

[Advanced React in the Wild](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168090/5d0bbb4a61 "largeapps.dev") — A round-up of case studies showing how five different engineering teams have pushed React to the limit in production and their real-world wins in areas like performance, Core Web Vitals, caching, and more. A lot to enjoy here!

[JSX Over the Wire](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168091/5d0bbb4a61 "overreacted.io") — Dan Abramov builds on last week’s epic [React for Two Computers](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168092/5d0bbb4a61) with thoughts on the evolution of passing data from server to client, contrasting traditional REST endpoints with a BFF approach that builds screen-specific ViewModels mirroring React’s component tree. An enjoyable train of thought for anyone interested in how and why client/server apps are organized the way they are and how it could be even better.

[Fastify + React – 7x Faster than Next.js?](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168093/5d0bbb4a61 "hire.jonasgalvez.com.br") — Node’s [Fastify](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168094/5d0bbb4a61) framework has a mature plugin for Vite integration ([explained in detail here](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168095/5d0bbb4a61)), including [@fastify/react](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168096/5d0bbb4a61) which [just hit version 1.0](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168096/5d0bbb4a61) and makes it easy to create fast, featureful (though obviously less so than Next.js) React apps atop Fastify. How fast? Very, it seems.

Jonas Galvez

[Creating an AI Chat Experience with React and OpenAI](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168097/5d0bbb4a61 "www.robinwieruch.de") — If you’d rather create your own streaming chat UI for OpenAI’s models (such as for the new API-only GPT 4.1 models) Robin has some pointers for getting started.

📄 [Migrating Grep from Create React App to Next.js](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168098/5d0bbb4a61) – That’s [Grep](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168099/5d0bbb4a61) the code search engine, not `grep` ;-) More technical detail here than I was expecting. Niser and Corbett (Vercel)

[RedwoodJS Evolving into Redwood GraphQL and RedwoodSDK](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168100/5d0bbb4a61 "redwoodjs.com") — The full-stack React-based framework is shaking things up with the existing GraphQL-oriented framework becoming _Redwood GraphQL_ and _RedwoodSDK_ being a more general app abstraction set to be explained properly in the coming weeks.

RedwoodJS

[react-photo-sphere-viewer: A Component to View Photo Spheres](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168101/5d0bbb4a61 "github.com") — This is one of those cases where [a live demo](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168102/5d0bbb4a61) is valuable. It’s basically a way to navigate specially-taken 360 degree photos (think Google Street View - kinda).

[Agent Hooks: Hooks That Bring Agents Into Your App](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168103/5d0bbb4a61 "github.com") — You could wire this sort of thing together yourself, but it provides an interesting abstraction.

*   The long-standing [records and tuples proposal for JavaScript has been withdrawn](https://react.statuscode.com/link/168117/5d0bbb4a61) at the latest TC39 meeting.
