[State of the post-quantum Internet in 2025](https://content.cloudflare.com/NzEzLVhTQy05MTgAAAGdysGTpBhDnjKqn1r4hrWWYGLY2oHWg6_Sc8wl_B3oe-6Q9174ajFX78MDfn_-J5JJ-ejhR-o=)

Today over half of human-initiated traffic with Cloudflare is protected against harvest-now/decrypt-later with post-quantum encryption.
