[Go and enhance your calm: demolishing an HTTP/2 interop problem](https://content.cloudflare.com/NzEzLVhTQy05MTgAAAGd2jRAVVtHm3Eb7-dB0gGD3VfwozRGhYa3FU0225Ov05-ojK_dcD6r58vPxgX7qOPoLVO6qvc=)

HTTP/2 implementations often respond to suspected attacks by closing the connection with an ENHANCE\_YOUR\_CALM error code. Learn how a common pattern of using Go's HTTP/2 client can lead to unintended errors and the solution to avoiding them.

[Beyond IP lists: a registry format for bots and agents](https://content.cloudflare.com/NzEzLVhTQy05MTgAAAGd2jRAVZFDMjRBEjXst7vTWY2IMUsaNOe_kwUaGr-Po1j43-nJgTEW3AwGEt4VPFxIgOOrjoc=)

We propose an open registry format for Web Bot Auth to move beyond IP-based identity. This allows any origin to discover and verify cryptographic keys for bots, fostering a decentralized and more trustworthy ecosystem.

[Anonymous credentials: rate-limiting bots and agents without compromising privacy](https://content.cloudflare.com/NzEzLVhTQy05MTgAAAGd2jRAVXEwjGQAzYVGixMMcaP9p7O4fBDwuVkZN2N7TWma6xEMkWztwoJN0qFrylruHzmOv4Y=)

As AI agents change how the Internet is used, they create a challenge for security. We explore how Anonymous Credentials can rate limit agent traffic and block abuse without tracking users or compromising their privacy.

[Policy, privacy and post-quantum: anonymous credentials for everyone](https://content.cloudflare.com/NzEzLVhTQy05MTgAAAGd2jRAVayHQHrvemZ6e-GF_bA0sZQyVrljxj9uN2XQfFuzJ2PA1_LJTmz9U_5WHJrIyP241UY=)

The world is adopting anonymous credentials for digital privacy, but these systems are vulnerable to quantum computers. This post explores the cryptographic challenges and promising research paths toward building new, quantum-resistant credentials from the ground up.
