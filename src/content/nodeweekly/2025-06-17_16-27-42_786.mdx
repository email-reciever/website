[Node.js Moves Toward Stable TypeScript Support with Amaro 1.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170484/0a4070b383 "socket.dev") — [Amaro](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170485/0a4070b383) is Node’s official way to strip types out of TypeScript code so that Node can run it (though you can also use Amaro as a library, if you prefer). The [1.0 release](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170486/0a4070b383) is a key milestone on the way to moving TypeScript support in Node.js from experimental to stable in a release later this year. Sarah rounds up the entire story.

By the end of it, you'll know everything you need to know about how TypeScript support in Node works and what its limitations are.

[pnpm 10.12 Introduces an Experimental Global Virtual Store](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170488/0a4070b383 "socket.dev") — [pnpm](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170489/0a4070b383) has long been prized for its speed and efficiency over `npm`. [v10.12](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170490/0a4070b383) takes things further introducing a ‘global virtual store’ that `node_modules` symlinks to, enabling projects to share dependencies without them being installed numerous times.
