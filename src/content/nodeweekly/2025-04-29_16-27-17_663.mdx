[Koa 3.0: The Expressive HTTP Middleware Framework](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168539/0a4070b383 "koajs.com") — Koa first appeared over a decade ago as a ‘next-generation’ Web framework that shared some of the lineage (and team) of Express.js, but leaning on more modern JavaScript features and ideas of the time. While Express has [been making a comeback recently](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168540/0a4070b383), Koa has progressed too and offers a compelling alternative.

[Node v22.15.0 (LTS) Released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168542/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — With over 300 commits, this is a meaty update for the most up to date LTS release of Node, though with no _huge_ features.
