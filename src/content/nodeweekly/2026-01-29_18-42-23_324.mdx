🌊 [Improving Single Executable Application Building in Node](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179985/0a4070b383 "joyeecheung.github.io") — First introduced two years ago, Node has a (still experimental) feature to [build single executable applications](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179986/0a4070b383) that can be deployed to machines that don’t have Node installed. This week’s Node.js 25.5 release, with its `--build-sea` flag, moves the final injection step into Node itself, eliminating the need for external tooling and turning what was a multi-step, low-level process into a single command.

[Node.js 25.5.0 (Current) Released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179987/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — The new `--build-sea` command-line flag is the headline feature _(see above)._ `node:sqlite` also [enables defensive mode](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179988/0a4070b383) by default, and `fs.watch` gains [an `ignore` option](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179989/0a4070b383) to filter filesystem events.

[Clerk MCP Server for AI Coding Assistants](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179984/0a4070b383 "go.clerk.com") — Your AI assistant hallucinates auth code because it's working from stale training data. The Clerk MCP server fixes that — connect Claude, Cursor, or Copilot to current SDK docs and get working implementations for middleware, protected routes, organizations, and RBAC.

📊 [Node.js 16 to 25 Benchmarked Version-by-Version](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180024/0a4070b383 "www.repoflow.io") — It’s interesting to see the jumps in different areas between different versions. The performance for certain tasks took a massive jump up with Node 25 in particular, while other improvements are more gradual.

RepoFlow

**IN BRIEF:**

*   Run `npx is-my-node-vulnerable` right now, suggests NodeSource. It's a tool, backed by the Node.js project, that checks if your Node.js install is vulnerable to known vulnerabilities.
    
*   Want to save yourself between 2ms and 260ms when running npm scripts? The [`nr` tool](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179991/0a4070b383), a new 'zero-overhead npm script runner written in Rust', might be worth a try.
    
*   Reddit's `/r/node` had a popular thread about [if you were starting fresh today, would you still pick Express?](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179992/0a4070b383) _"I wouldn't even choose Node,"_ said one commenter. Ouch!
    
*   🔒 [The OpenJS Foundation has shared an annual report](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179993/0a4070b383) covering its efforts in securing the Node.js ecosystem and other OpenJS projects.
    
*   Fancy quickly testing your typing speed? Try `npx typex-cli`
