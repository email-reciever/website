[Node.js TSC Votes to Stop Distributing Corepack](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167202/0a4070b383 "socket.dev") — [Corepack](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167203/0a4070b383) was introduced as an (experimental) tool _bundled with Node_ to help with managing versions of your package managers. Corepack will live on as a separately installable tool, but will be phased out from future Node releases following [a recent TSC vote](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167204/0a4070b383).

[New URLPattern API Brings Improved Pattern Matching to Node](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167205/0a4070b383 "blog.cloudflare.com") — The Cloudflare Workers team has implemented the [URLPattern API](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167206/0a4070b383) in the [Ada](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167207/0a4070b383) URL parser, used by both Node.js and Cloudflare Workers. The API lets you take patterns like `/blog/:year/:month/:slug` and test whether URLs match against them. If you’re using Node 23.8+, you can start using it today.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [Bun 1.2.6 has been released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167208/0a4070b383) with notable performance improvements for Express and Fastify, improved `node:crypto` compatibility, and even initial support for `node:test`. Now's a great time to see how your Node apps work (or not) on the fast JavaScriptCore-based runtime.
    
*   🤖 [MCP Node.js Debugger](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167209/0a4070b383) is an attempt to make Node's debugger more accessible to third-party AI coding tools (such as Cursor or Claude Code).

[Errsole.js: Collect, Store, and Visualize Node App Logs](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167212/0a4070b383 "github.com") — Rather than leaning on a third-party service for log monitoring, the idea of Errsole is you just drop its package into your app and you get logging and a basic UI for looking at those logs all ‘out of the box’. It supports numerous storage mechanisms, from SQLite in dev to MySQL, Postgres and MongoDB in production.
