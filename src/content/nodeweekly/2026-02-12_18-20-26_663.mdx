TypeScript 6.0 enters beta, but what does it mean for Node developers?

[TypeScript 6.0 is now in beta.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180632/0a4070b383) It's a _"clean up your tsconfig"_ release, not meant to wow but to make sense as a _bridge_ to the eventual [Go-powered 'native' TypeScript 7 compiler.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180633/0a4070b383)

There are, however, several notable updates for Node developers:

*   [`--strict` is now true by default.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180674/0a4070b383) Projects that relied on the previous default of `false` will need to set it explicitly.
    
*   [`types` now defaults to `[]`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180669/0a4070b383) which will affect many projects. `rootDir` now defaults to `.` too, which can silently change your output directory structure.
    
*   [Subpath import starting with `#/`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180670/0a4070b383), so packages can use a simple prefix for subpath imports without needing an extra segment.
    
*   [The inclusion of types for Temporal.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180671/0a4070b383)
    
*   `--esModuleInterop` and `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` can [no longer be set to `false`.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180672/0a4070b383) If you have imports that rely on the old behavior, you may need to adjust them.
    
*   And, unsurprisingly, a lot more, though here are the [breaking changes and deprecations](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180673/0a4070b383) to be aware of.

[npmx: A Better npm Registry Package Browser](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180634/0a4070b383 "npmx.dev") — A new, fast way to browse the [official npm registry](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180635/0a4070b383). The search works well, and you see more data on package pages (e.g. [`axios`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180636/0a4070b383)). It's not a replacement for the registry, but makes browsing `npmjs․com` feel outdated. The [package comparison tool](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180637/0a4070b383) is neat too.

[How to Make an HTTP Request in Node.js](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180638/0a4070b383 "nodejsdesignpatterns.com") — Easy. Just use `fetch`, right? Okay, how do we use it, how do we set timeouts, how do we stream requests and responses? Retries. Concurrent requests. Mocking. There’s a lot involved and Luciano does a fantastic job of boiling down the techniques, as well as when to consider using Undici or `http`/`https` directly.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   👀 Matteo Collina is [working on a first-class virtual file system module](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180639/0a4070b383) for Node that integrates with `fs`.
    
*   [Node.js 25.6.1 (Current)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180640/0a4070b383) has been released. It brings the new [`merve`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180641/0a4070b383) lexer for extracting named exports from CommonJS modules into play (it's [25% faster](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180642/0a4070b383) than [`cjs-module-lexer`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180643/0a4070b383)).
    
*   [Node.js 24.13.1 (LTS)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180644/0a4070b383) has been released with Unicode 17 URL parsing support, `crypto.hash` and `--build-snapshot` marked as stable, plus dependency updates and bug fixes.
    
*   [ESLint 10.0 has been released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180645/0a4070b383) completing the removal of the `eslintrc` config system and introducing a new config lookup algorithm starting from the linted file (nice for monorepos).
    
*   [Bun 1.3.9](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180646/0a4070b383) adds the ability to run multiple `package.json` scripts concurrently/sequentially, `Bun.markdown.react()` gets faster, and regexes get a SIMD boost.

Not ready for prime time, but an interesting idea with a neat live demo on the homepage.
