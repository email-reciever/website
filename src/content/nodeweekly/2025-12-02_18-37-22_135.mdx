You can then benchmark whatever functions you want, specify how long or how many times to benchmark for, and get a variety of stats in return – it runs across multiple runtimes, too. [GitHub repo.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177811/0a4070b383)

📈 [Comparing _AWS Lambda_ ARM64 vs x86 Performance Across Runtimes and Node Versions](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177812/0a4070b383 "chrisebert.net") — A developer puts Node.js, Python, and Rust through their paces on Amazon’s serverless platform. On the Node side, Node 22 beats Node 20 by 8-11% across the board, but Node functions on ARM run even faster than on x86. Chris concludes: _“Switching to arm64 is the easiest performance win you can get.”_ As always with benchmarks, your own results may vary.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [Express v5.2 was released yesterday](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177813/0a4070b383) but note that v5.2.1 followed today, [reverting a security fix in 5.2.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177814/0a4070b383) that would have broken apps in certain situations. [v4.22.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177815/0a4070b383) and [v4.22.1](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177816/0a4070b383) were also released and follow the same pattern.
    
*   Node 24 LTS is now available [for builds and functions on Vercel.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177817/0a4070b383)
    
*   We featured news about the 'Shai-Hulud 2.0' npm worm issue last week, but [DataDog has published a good summary of what's going on.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177818/0a4070b383)
    
*   The Electron project has [entered a 'quiet month'](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177819/0a4070b383) to give the maintainers a rest before getting back to full steam in January. They also use the post to review what happened with Electron in 2025.
    
*   We picked up on the release of Prisma 7 last week, but missed [the official release post](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177820/0a4070b383) which does a great job of explaining its full value proposition.
    

[Node.js 24 Runtime Now Available in AWS Lambda](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177821/0a4070b383 "aws.amazon.com") — We noticed this briefly last week, but now there’s a full blog post showing off what’s new with Node.js on Amazon’s serverless platform. It also acts as a good quick primer on what changed in Node.js 24 overall, even if you don’t use Lambda.

💡 AWS Lambda has also [introduced 'Managed Instances'](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177822/0a4070b383) if you want to keep Lambda's serverless workflow but running on EC2 instances of your own.

[Wrangling My Email with Claude Code](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177823/0a4070b383 "jlongster.com") — James shows how you can use Claude’s [‘agent skills’](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177824/0a4070b383) to run a Node app that fetches your email from Gmail for Claude Code to analyze.
