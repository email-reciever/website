⚠️ [The Node.js January 13, 2026 Security Releases](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179261/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — Originally expected in December, these releases (of [Node.js 25.3.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179262/0a4070b383), [24.13.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179263/0a4070b383), [22.22.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179264/0a4070b383), and [20.20.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179265/0a4070b383)) finally landed this week, largely due to their complexity and the scope of the vulnerabilities they tackle. More on that in the next item!

[Mitigating a DoS Vulnerability Related to `async_hooks`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179266/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — A deep dive into one of the five vulnerabilities tackled by the releases above where apps using `async_hooks` or `AsyncLocalStorage` (e.g. React, Next.js, and those using APM tooling) can be forced to exit _without throwing a catchable error_ when recursions in user code exhaust the stack space. Node has mitigated some of the problem, but library and framework creators also have work to do around this issue.

[The Official Node.js Package Configuration Guide](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179268/0a4070b383 "nodejs.github.io") — It’s still under development, but the Node team has begun to share an official guide to putting together and configuring your own packages for Node, whether for the first time or if you’re migrating an existing package to ESM and modern best practices.

[Node.js Becomes a First-Class Citizen in Microsoft Aspire](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179273/0a4070b383 "devblogs.microsoft.com") — [Aspire](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179274/0a4070b383) is a Microsoft framework for orchestrating the development and deployment of distributed applications.
