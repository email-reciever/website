[Optimizing Node Performance with V8 GC Optimization](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168241/0a4070b383 "blog.platformatic.dev") — Matteo recently [▶️ gave a talk](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168242/0a4070b383) at dotJS about Node’s memory usage and decided to write it up into a blog post too. Matteo notes that high memory usage doesn’t necessarily mean you have a memory leak, explains how V8’s garbage collector works, and how you can tune things specifically for your own use case.

[Microsoft Warns About Node.js' Role in Modern Malware](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168243/0a4070b383 "www.microsoft.com") — Microsoft’s security team is observing a sharp increase in the use of Node.js to deliver malware and other malicious payloads.

[Node v20.19.1 (LTS) Released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168244/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — You know it’s a quiet week when a .1 release is feature-worthy news. Little here except dependency bumps, though, but it’s always good to see an update of what remains a popular Node version (though Node 22 ‘Jod’ should now be your LTS version of choice, ideally).
