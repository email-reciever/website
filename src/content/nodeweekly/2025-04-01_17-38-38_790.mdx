[Express 5.1: Express 5 Finally Becomes the 'Latest' Release](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167495/0a4070b383 "expressjs.com") — After a period of some dormancy, [Express 5.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167496/0a4070b383) was released last year, but remained a somewhat experimental ‘edge’ release as it went through [a security audit](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167497/0a4070b383) and process of building up new governance. With 5.1, however, Express 5.x finally becomes the ‘`latest`’ tagged release on npm, so be careful with those upgrades (luckily there’s [a migration guide](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167498/0a4070b383)).

💬 I was amused by [some discussion about the release](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167499/0a4070b383) on Reddit, where maintainer Wes Todd said: _"We tried to kill \[Express\] over and over and it keeps on getting up and converting more people into zombies for the zombie mob. So we did the best we could to research a way to bring it back from zombie status."_

[ThePrimeagen's Dev Setup Is Better Than Yours](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167494/0a4070b383 "frontendmasters.com") — See why simpler dev tooling is better by hand-crafting an environment with bash scripts. You'll learn common Unix tools for managing libraries, interacting with the OS, window management, and more in this course.

[Land Ahoy: Leaving the Sea of Nodes](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167500/0a4070b383 "v8.dev") — A deeply technical post from a core member of the V8 JavaScript engine team that explains the limitations of Turbofan, one of V8’s optimizing compilers. If you don’t care for the internals of how your JavaScript is compiled and run, just be assured the V8 team is working to make it run even faster!

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [Node v18.20.8 (LTS)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167501/0a4070b383) has been released. It's noteworthy mostly due to v18 going 'end of life' later this month. OpenSSL and root certificates get a bump to keep you going for a little longer, but you should update from v18 to v20 or v22 whenever you can.
    
*   [Access to Node.js's test CI infrastructure has been restricted](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167502/0a4070b383) due to an as-yet-undisclosed vulnerability. A full report of the incident is forthcoming.

[Playwright MCP: Connect LLMs to Browsers with Playwright](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167509/0a4070b383 "github.com") — MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers enable certain LLM-based agents (such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor) to perform actions on systems outside of their usual sandbox. This new project from Microsoft enables such LLMs to interact with Web pages via Playwright.

[Neutralinojs 6.0: Alternative Cross-Platform Desktop App Approach](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167510/0a4070b383 "neutralino.js.org") — [Neutralinojs](https://nodeweekly.com/link/167511/0a4070b383) offers an interesting lightweight alternative to something like Electron, as it still lets you build apps that run on Linux, Windows and macOS, but Chromium isn’t bundled – instead the existing installed browser engine is used.
