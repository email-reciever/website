[How V8 is Making `JSON.stringify` More Than Twice as Fast](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172656/0a4070b383 "v8.dev") — The V8 team has made `JSON.stringify` over twice as fast, giving your apps an automatic performance boost for common tasks like API responses and caching, at least once Node upgrades to V8 13.8 (Node 24 uses V8 13.6). This article unpacks the low-level work behind the speedup.

[Announcing TypeScript 5.9](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172658/0a4070b383 "devblogs.microsoft.com") — v5.9 is one of TypeScript's gentler evolutionary steps, with no big features, but we do get [support for `import defer`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172659/0a4070b383), a [new `--module node20`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172660/0a4070b383) option, and ‘expandable hovers’ in editors like VS Code to see expanded type information. We also learn a little about TypeScript 6.0 which will act as a ‘transition point’ to get prepared for [the Go-powered ‘native port’ of TypeScript](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172661/0a4070b383) which will become TypeScript 7.0.

It gives a good roundup of some of Node's more recently added features.
    

[Node.js v22.18 (LTS) Gets Type Stripping by Default](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172669/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — A big tweak for an LTS release: type stripping/TypeScript support is enabled by default, making `node app.ts` a reality, much as with Bun or Deno. It is, however, still considered ‘experimental.’
