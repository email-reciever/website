[php-node: A New Way to Bring PHP and Node Together](https://nodeweekly.com/link/169978/0a4070b383 "blog.platformatic.dev") — I bet some readers have strong feelings about the idea of mixing PHP and Node.js, but this is a neat project. [php-node](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170014/0a4070b383) is a native module for Node that enables the running of PHP apps within the Node environment. Why? For migrating legacy apps, building hybrid PHP/JS apps, or Node apps that simply need to call out to PHP for some reason (WordPress, maybe, as we see in this post).
