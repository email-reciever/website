[Announcing TypeScript 5.8](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166358/0a4070b383 "devblogs.microsoft.com") — Four months in the making, TypeScript 5.8 lands with a strong Node focus. You can now [use `require()` for ES modules in the `nodenext` module](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166359/0a4070b383), there’s [a new `node18` module](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166399/0a4070b383) for developers who want to keep targeting Node 18, and most notably there’s now [an `--erasableSyntaxOnly` option](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166360/0a4070b383) to ensure no TypeScript-only runtime semantics can be used (ideal if you’re using [Node’s type stripping features](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166361/0a4070b383) to run TypeScript code directly).

[Turbocharging V8 with Mutable Heap Numbers](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166362/0a4070b383 "v8.dev") — The V8 team uses the JetStream2 benchmark suite to investigate performance issues and has implemented a new optimization yielding not just a 2.5x improvement in the `async-fs` benchmark but in other areas too. A demonstration that not only does the Node team make Node faster, the V8 team does too.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [Node v23.9.0 (Current)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166363/0a4070b383) has been released – it's a very minor release, however, focused mostly on bug fixes and incremental tweaks.
    
*   Next.js 15.2 has been released [with support for using Node.js for Next.js' Middleware.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166364/0a4070b383)
    
*   Node is introducing [an experimental JSON-based configuration option](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166365/0a4070b383) to simplify the use of features (like the [test runner](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166366/0a4070b383)) that otherwise tend to use a lot of configuration flags.
    
*   [An unfortunate update on QUIC support in Node.js.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166367/0a4070b383)
    

[Web Scraping with Playwright](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166368/0a4070b383 "wanago.io") — I’d be surprised if you got away with scraping YouTube like this for long (let’s say Google aren’t big fans of the approach) but the techniques demonstrated are useful more generally too.
