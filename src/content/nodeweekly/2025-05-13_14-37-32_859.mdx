🖊️ I'm going to [Google I/O](https://nodeweekly.com/link/169164/0a4070b383) next week, so Node Weekly will be taking a break and will return on May 27. If you happen to be at I/O too, say hi if you see an Englishman rambling on about newsletters!

[Feedsmith: A Fresh New Web Feed Parser and Generator](https://nodeweekly.com/link/169166/0a4070b383 "github.com") — The creator of Feedsmith ran into numerous problems with existing libraries, so created this new, modern way to both parse and generate RSS, Atom, JSON Feed, OPML, and RDF feeds with support for common namespaces as used in podcast, media, and other niche types of feed. It’s still early days but the essentials are there.
