[Laravel and Node.js: PHP in Watt Runtime](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172022/0a4070b383 "blog.platformatic.dev") — In June we featured [php-node](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172023/0a4070b383), a new way to ‘bridge the gap’ between PHP and Node.js by being able to embed PHP into Node apps. Now they’ve gone a step further by using php-node and the [Watt](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172024/0a4070b383) app server to enable the running of [Laravel](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172025/0a4070b383) apps too. A curious meeting of ecosystems!

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [The eslint-config-prettier package was recently compromised](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172030/0a4070b383) and we get a pretty thorough analysis of how it worked and how it happened.
