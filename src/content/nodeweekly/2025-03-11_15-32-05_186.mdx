[Node Added TypeScript Support, But What Does That Mean for Deno?](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166668/0a4070b383 "deno.com") — The Deno team, learning from previous experiences with Node, went ‘all in’ with TypeScript from day one. Now, Node can work with TypeScript too, but the experience is still very different, and the Deno team explains how here.

[Updates on CVE for End-of-Life Versions](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166669/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — Back in January, the Node.js project decided to [issue CVEs for end-of-life versions of Node](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166670/0a4070b383) to warn people of the security impacts of using old versions of Node. This [didn’t go down well](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166671/0a4070b383) and so the Node project has a new plan going forward.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   Alternative JS runtime [Bun v1.2.5 has been released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166672/0a4070b383) with _"much better Node-API compatibility."_ An 'almost' total rewrite of Bun's Node-API implementation now means more Node-API powered modules will work with Bun.
    
*   A North Korean group of hackers is [continuing with its attempts to poison the npm ecosystem](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166673/0a4070b383) with nefarious packages.
