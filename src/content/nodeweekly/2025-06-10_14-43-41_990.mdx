[PSA: Beware of End-of-Life Node.js Versions](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170180/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — Matteo Collina notes the Node.js ecosystem is _“at a critical juncture”_, with v18 and earlier now ‘End-of-Life’. He breaks down what that really means for users of legacy versions, and why you should skip Active LTS v20 and leap straight to v22 for maximum future-proofing. If you _have_ to stay on older versions, though, Matteo shares an option to consider.

[Node v24.2.0 (Current) Released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170182/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — `import.meta.main` is a new boolean value available in ES modules that tells you if the current module was the entry point of the current process (so you could run specific code only if a module is run directly, say). Support for HTTP/2 priority signalling has also been removed from nghttp2.

💡 [This change](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170183/0a4070b383) also means you don't need to pass the entrypoint of your app to `--allow-fs-read` if using [the permissions system.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170184/0a4070b383)

**IN BRIEF:**

*   Sarah Gooding gives a good roundup of [the proposals discussed and advanced at TC39's recent meeting](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170185/0a4070b383) including `Array.fromAsync`, `Error.isError`, and explicit resource management.
    
*   It's been a few years since the last major release of the popular testing framework, but [Jest 30 is out now](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170216/0a4070b383) with a raft of significant improvements.
    
*   [SQLite-JS](https://nodeweekly.com/link/170186/0a4070b383) is an interesting SQLite extension that adds the ability to write custom SQLite functions using JavaScript.
