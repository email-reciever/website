🤖 [Mastra 1.0: An AI Framework from the Former Gatsby Team](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179594/0a4070b383 "mastra.ai") — An all-in-one framework ([homepage](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179595/0a4070b383)) for building AI powered apps and agents. With v1.0, you can now bundle agents and workflows into existing Node apps using several new adapter packages to run Mastra inside existing Express, Hono, Fastify or Koa apps. Support for [Vercel’s AI SDK](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179596/0a4070b383) v6 has also been added.

Shortly thereafter, Matteo Collina dropped [pprof-to-md](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179600/0a4070b383).
    
*   The AdonisJS team has announced [AdonisJS v7 is feature complete](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179601/0a4070b383) and in final testing before a public release in a few weeks.
    
*   [The Boring JavaScript Stack](https://nodeweekly.com/link/179602/0a4070b383) has hit version 1.0 – it's an _'opinionated full-stack JavaScript project starter'_ built around Sails, Inertia, Tailwind CSS, and your choice of Vue, React or Svelte.
