⚠️ [Shai Hulud 2.0: The Widespread npm Supply Chain Attack is Back](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177479/0a4070b383 "about.gitlab.com") — The big story this week is an evolution of a [previous story](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177480/0a4070b383) we’ve covered about a 'worm' that spreads through npm packages. GitLab does a good job of explaining what’s going on: an infected package gets installed then executes a malicious payload which exfiltrates GitHub, npm, and other credentials, then infects and publishes yet more packages.

💡 Numerous sources have written about this latest wave of attacks including [Wiz](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177481/0a4070b383), [Snyk](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177482/0a4070b383), [Socket](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177483/0a4070b383), [Aikido](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177484/0a4070b383) and [HelixGuard.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177485/0a4070b383) Corridor's [Shai Hulud 2.0 Detector](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177486/0a4070b383) can also be used to scan a `package.json` file for known affected packages.

*   [Node.js v20.19.6 (LTS) has been released.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177487/0a4070b383) It's a minor LTS release with updates to root certificates and OpenSSL, plus the deprecation of HTTP/2 priority signalling (as is the case in [RFC 9113](https://nodeweekly.com/link/177488/0a4070b383) also).
    
*   Node.js 24 is now a supported runtime on _AWS Lambda_ (as `nodejs24.x`) and won't be deprecated until April 30, 2028.
