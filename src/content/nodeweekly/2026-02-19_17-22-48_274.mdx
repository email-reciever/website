[Halving Node.js Memory Usage with Pointer Compression](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180908/0a4070b383 "blog.platformatic.dev") — Does 50% memory savings in production sound good? Cloudflare, Igalia, and the Node project have collaborated on `node-caged`, a Docker image containing Node 25 with V8 pointer compression enabled. Matteo digs into all the details here – this is neat work, though there are tradeoffs to consider.

[npm v11.10.0 Released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180910/0a4070b383 "github.blog") — `npm install` gains a `--allow-git` flag that defaults to `all` for now, but is expected to become `none` in npm 12+. Maintainers can also now add/update trusted publishing configs across multiple packages in a single operation. Also, and curiously not covered in the release post, is [`--min-release-age`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180911/0a4070b383).

GitHub

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [Node.js 25.6.1 (Current)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180912/0a4070b383) has been released replacing `cjs-module-lexer` with `merv`. [v24.13.1 (LTS)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180913/0a4070b383) has also been released.
    
*   ⭐ [The Temporal API is close to being enabled by default](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180914/0a4070b383) in a future Node.js release.
    
*   Joyee Cheung has added the ability for Node [single executable applications (SEA)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180915/0a4070b383) to [support ESM entrypoints](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180916/0a4070b383) (non-builtin access is not supported, but Matteo Collina's [work on a virtual file system module](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180917/0a4070b383) may enable that).
    
*   🔒 npm package pages [now link directly to Socket's security analysis](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180918/0a4070b383) for each package. Here's [the one for `express`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180919/0a4070b383), for example.
    
*   Node's `zlib` is also about to get [support for custom Brotli compression dictionaries.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180920/0a4070b383)
    

📊 [Node.js vs Deno vs Bun Performance Benchmarks](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180921/0a4070b383 "www.repoflow.io") — A few weeks ago, RepoFlow did a handy [version-by-version Node benchmark](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180922/0a4070b383) and now they’re back with some micro-benchmarks comparing Node, Deno and Bun. As always with benchmarks, apply a critical eye!

[Introducing `@stoolap/node`: Fast Bindings to an Embedded SQL Database](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180923/0a4070b383 "stoolap.io") — [Stoolap](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180924/0a4070b383) is a high-performance, pure-Rust embedded SQL database that compiles to WebAssembly ([play with it here](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180925/0a4070b383)). It now includes NAPI-RS powered Node.js bindings. In this post, Semih tackles the inevitable _“Why not just use SQLite?”_ question: chiefly, lock-free MVCC means readers never block writers.
