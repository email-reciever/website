[The State of JavaScript 2025: Backend Frameworks](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180252/0a4070b383 "2025.stateofjs.com") — The results of the popular annual JavaScript survey are out, and we’re focusing on the most relevant bit to Node.js: _backend frameworks_. [Express](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180300/0a4070b383) still leads the way, but [NestJS](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180253/0a4070b383) continues to grow rapidly. Meanwhile, [Hono](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180254/0a4070b383) comes top in developer satisfaction.

[How to Migrate from Chalk to Node's `styleText`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180267/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — [Chalk](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180268/0a4070b383) is great for terminal styling, but Node's built-in `styleText` handles most of the same tasks with no dependency required. There's even a codemod to migrate automatically.

[Explicit Resource Management in JavaScript](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180269/0a4070b383 "allthingssmitty.com") — You can use `using` for deterministic cleanup, calling `Symbol.dispose`/`asyncDispose` at scope exit without `try`/`finally`. A small fix for leaks and forgotten teardowns in streams, observers, locks, and similar APIs.

[Why JSBin Went Down for 3 Days (and How It Was Fixed)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180270/0a4070b383 "remysharp.com") — [JSBin](https://nodeweekly.com/link/180271/0a4070b383), the long-running collaborative JavaScript pastebin, went offline for roughly three days in January after a huge traffic spike overwhelmed its tiny single-CPU server. Node.js wasn’t the root cause, but running an ancient Node 7(!) runtime amplified the failure. Remy tells the full story.
