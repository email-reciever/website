[Subverting Control with Weak References](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166024/0a4070b383 "jlongster.com") — Node supports `WeakMap` and [`WeakRef`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166025/0a4070b383) for working with weak references and James is a big fan of the extra abstractions they unlock. A weak reference differs from a normal reference in that it _doesn’t_ prevent a referenced object from being garbage collected – this might sound like it has limited value, but is quite useful in certain scenarios.

[Node v23.8.0 (Current) Released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166026/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — You can now tell Node to use the system’s trusted CA certificate store with `--use-system-ca` and there’s an implementation of the [URL Pattern API](https://nodeweekly.com/link/166027/0a4070b383) (`URLPattern` will become a global in Node 24). Other minor enhancements include an update to Node’s timezone data and initial support for the zstd compression algorithm (via `node:zlib`).
