**IN BRIEF:**

*   [TypeScript 5.9 RC](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172335/0a4070b383) has been released, with the final release due later this week. Support for `import defer` and the new `--module node20` feature are amongst the highlights.
    
*   It's early days but [Google has unveiled OSS Rebuild](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172336/0a4070b383), an attempt to make open source ecosystems (like npm) more secure by allowing the comparison of packages with upstream artifacts.
    
*   Attacks on the npm ecosystem have continued with [the `is` package getting hijacked](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172337/0a4070b383) through an npm-related typosquatted domain being used to [phish login details.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172338/0a4070b383)
    

[The Node Developer's Guide to Unix Domain Sockets](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172339/0a4070b383 "nodevibe.substack.com") — The TLDR: _“Unix domain sockets deliver ~50% lower latency than TCP loopback for Node.js IPC.”_

▶  [The Creator of Bun on Building Bun and Node.js Compatibility](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172340/0a4070b383 "www.youtube.com") — A roughly half hour chat in which Patrick Akil speaks with Jarred Sumner, creator of [Bun](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172341/0a4070b383). “_We intend for Bun to be a drop-in replacement for the existing Node.js ecosystem. Most of our engineering time is not actually spent on new features — it’s spent on Node.js compatibility_”.
