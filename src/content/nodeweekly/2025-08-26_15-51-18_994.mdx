[How We Migrated Our Rush.js Monorepo to Node Type Stripping](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173281/0a4070b383 "blog.calm.com") — Since v23.6 (and in LTS since [v22.18.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173282/0a4070b383)), Node has supported running (most) TypeScript code by [stripping the types out](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173326/0a4070b383) first. The Calm team was excited about the potential for improving productivity and DX, and set a migration in process. Here’s a look at the challenges encountered and what the end results were.

[Speeding Up the JavaScript Ecosystem: Semver](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173283/0a4070b383 "marvinh.dev") — The latest in Marvin’s multi-year series of posts on optimizing heavily used parts of the JavaScript ecosystem: _“During the installation process, package managers run a bunch of semver comparisons. The `semver` library used in npm, yarn and pnpm can be made around 33x faster.”_

**IN BRIEF:**

*   Bun 1.3 is just around the corner, but [Bun v1.2.1 has just been released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173284/0a4070b383) with highlights including `Bun.SQL`, a first-class database client supporting MySQL, SQLite and Postgres, and a [500x faster `postMessage(string)` function.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173285/0a4070b383)
    
*   In ESLint v9.34.0, ESLint has [added support for multithreaded linting](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173286/0a4070b383) which offers the potential for huge speedups on large projects.
    
*   Vercel Functions running on the Node.js runtime [now support `fetch` web handlers.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173287/0a4070b383)
    
*   [Next.js 15.5 was released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173288/0a4070b383) with stable support for Node.js middleware runtime.
    

[Eliminating JavaScript Cold Starts on AWS Lambda](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173289/0a4070b383 "goose.icu") — [Porffor](https://nodeweekly.com/link/173290/0a4070b383) is an _ahead-of-time_ JavaScript compiler which gives the benefit of rapid process launch times (i.e. under a millisecond). This is more a taste of the future, and something to experiment with, rather than to deploy into production ASAP.
