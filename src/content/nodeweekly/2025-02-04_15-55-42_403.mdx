[Announcing TypeScript 5.8 Beta: A Big One for Node Developers](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165174/0a4070b383 "devblogs.microsoft.com") — It's unusual for a TypeScript beta to be exciting for Node developers in particular, but while TypeScript 5.8 is low on features generally, it's _really_ Node focused with [support for `require()` of ES modules in the `nodenext` mode](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165175/0a4070b383), a [stable `--module node18`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165176/0a4070b383), and most notably [a `--erasableSyntaxOnly` option](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165177/0a4070b383) for ensuring the use of TypeScript that Node 22.6+'s type-stripping features can deal with.

McDonnell, Hiller, and Blass

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [Node.js v23.7.0 (Current) has been released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165183/0a4070b383) with many bug fixes and tweaks. You can now [use glob patterns in the `exclude` option](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165184/0a4070b383) of glob functions and [there's a new error](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165185/0a4070b383) to let TypeScript users know unsupported TypeScript features are present in their code.
    
*   Josh Goldberg explains [the differences between ESLint and TypeScript,](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165186/0a4070b383) beyond the obvious.
    
*   [Publican](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165187/0a4070b383) is a promising, new, Node.js-powered static site generator.
    
*   [Harmony](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165227/0a4070b383), from [Bit](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165228/0a4070b383), describes itself as a 'minimalistic stitching layer for composable architectures' – think a cross between monoliths and microservices without the downsides of each.
    

[The Modern Way to Write JavaScript Servers?](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165188/0a4070b383 "marvinh.dev") — The irony is that while Node popularized JavaScript on the server (if we ignore Netscape's attempts in the 90s) this modern, standardized cross-runtime approach _doesn’t_ quite work on bare Node (yet – though you can [polyfill it.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165189/0a4070b383))

[parse-duration 2.0: Convert a Human Readable Duration to Milliseconds](https://nodeweekly.com/link/165195/0a4070b383 "github.com") — You might wonder why a library that converts `1hr 20mins` into `4800000` needs a version 2.
