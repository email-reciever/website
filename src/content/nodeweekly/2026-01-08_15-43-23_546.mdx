[npm to Implement 'Staged Publishing' After Turbulent Shift Off Classic Tokens](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178928/0a4070b383 "socket.dev") — 2025 was a tricky year for the npm ecosystem with phishing attacks, [Shai Hulud](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178929/0a4070b383), and [changes to npm’s token system](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178930/0a4070b383).
