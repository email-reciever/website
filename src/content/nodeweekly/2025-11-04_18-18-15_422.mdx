[Node v22 to v24 Migration Guide](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176500/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — Now that v24 is the new active LTS release, you might have code running on v22 you need to upgrade. The Node team has put together this helpful guide to the changes you’ll need to negotiate. There are similar guides for [v20 to v22](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176501/0a4070b383), [v14 to 16](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176502/0a4070b383), and [v12 to v14](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176503/0a4070b383).

💡 There are also [official userland migration codemods](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176504/0a4070b383) to assist with upgrades. For example, there's one to change `import .. assert` to `import .. with` in a [v20 to v22 migration](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176501/0a4070b383), say.

[Importing Node Modules from BitTorrent](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176505/0a4070b383 "evanhahn.com") — There's little practical motivation for this in production, but it's a fascinating experiment that shows off what Node’s [customization hooks](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176506/0a4070b383) can do for overriding imports.

[Node.js 24 Becomes LTS: What You Need to Know](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176507/0a4070b383 "nodesource.com") — [Node v24.11.0 (LTS)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176508/0a4070b383) has arrived and marks Node 24’s transition to becoming the active LTS release. There are no changes from the prior v24 release, but Lizz looks at how Node 24 differs from 22 if you’re upgrading.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [Node.js v25.1.0 (Current)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176509/0a4070b383) has been released.
    
*   A brief reminder that in the next week or two, [npm will revoke all classic npm tokens](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176510/0a4070b383) and fail to generate new ones.
    
*   If Vercel support was preventing you from giving [Bun](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176511/0a4070b383) a try, [Vercel now supports the Bun runtime.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176512/0a4070b383) Or, more on the Node side of things, [they now support Fastify apps with zero-configuration.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176513/0a4070b383)
    

[Running Node.js in a Hugging Face Space](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176514/0a4070b383 "blog.tomayac.com") — If you, like Thomas, were saddened by the [closure of Glitch](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176515/0a4070b383) — here’s a brief look at using [Hugging Face Spaces](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176516/0a4070b383) (most commonly associated with ML projects) as an alternative for hosting small server-based Node apps.
