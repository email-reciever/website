[Node.js Security Best Practices](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176817/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — Did you know the Node.js project maintains a page about security best practices organized around how to mitigate ten of the most significant vectors? Topics include networking weaknesses, timing attacks, supply chain attacks, and the monkey patching of intrinsics.

💡 On security, Liran Tal's [Awesome Node.js Security](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176818/0a4070b383) is always worth a revisit and includes numerous resources and a timeline of notable security incidents. OWASP has also just released an RC of [its list of the top ten webapp security threats in 2025.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176819/0a4070b383)

[Agentic Postgres: AI-Ready Postgres for Go Developers](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176816/0a4070b383 "www.tigerdata.com") — Tiger Data’s Agentic Postgres turns vanilla Postgres into an AI-native database. Fork DBs, give agents memory, and query via REST or CLI. Perfect for Go backends building with Claude, Cursor, or custom agents. Try it free—no card needed.

[pnpm 10.21: Safer Installs and Smarter Runtime Management](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176820/0a4070b383 "pnpm.io") — pnpm can now automatically install the Node version required by a dependency, declared in its `engines.runtime` field, meaning CLI apps and `postinstall` scripts will run with the specified version. A new `trustPolicy` setting also adds protection against supply-chain attacks by failing to install packages whose trust level drops (e.g. if a package’s build pipeline loses attestation).

**IN BRIEF:**

*   GitHub has updated [its post about ongoing npm security changes](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176821/0a4070b383). npm classic tokens can no longer be created, but existing ones will continue to work until February 2026 at the latest.
