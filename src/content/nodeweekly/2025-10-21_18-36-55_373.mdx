[Node.js v25.0.0 (Current) Released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175881/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — The latest cutting edge version of Node has arrived with Web Storage enabled by default, `JSON.stringify` perf improvements, a new `--allow-net` option in the [permission model](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175882/0a4070b383), built-in `Uint8Array` base64/hex conversion, and WebAssembly and JIT optimizations. As shown in the diagram above, this means Node 24 will soon be promoted to being the 'active' LTS release and Node 22 will enter its 'maintenance' LTS phase.

💡 [Node v22.21.0 (LTS)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175883/0a4070b383) has also been released with `--use-env-proxy` and `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` HTTP proxy support backported.

[How a Node.js Backpressure Example Led Me to Explore DTrace](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175889/0a4070b383 "tylerhillery.com") — Backpressure (which you can [learn more about here](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175890/0a4070b383)) is a mechanism by which a stream can prevent producers from sending more data until the consumer(s) catch up. Tyler used DTrace to measure how disabling backpressure causes garbage collection to spike dramatically in Node.js.
