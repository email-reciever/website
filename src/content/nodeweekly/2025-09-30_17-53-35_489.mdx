[Read on the Web](https://nodeweekly.com/issues/594)

🗓️ We're back after taking a week off for my birthday. I've never bothered to do that before, but I figured I'd give it a go, and.. it was good 😅 We're now back every week until Christmas!

[A Year of Improving Node.js Compatibility in _Cloudflare Workers_](https://nodeweekly.com/link/174913/0a4070b383 "blog.cloudflare.com") — _“We’ve been busy,”_ says Cloudflare [which recently announced](https://nodeweekly.com/link/174914/0a4070b383) it’s bringing Node.js HTTP server support to its _Workers_ function platform. This post goes _deep_ into the technicalities, covering what areas of the standard library is supported, how the file system works (_Workers_ doesn’t have a typical file system), how input/output streams work, and more. And you can use all of this now.

[Electron-Based Apps Causing System-Wide Lag on macOS 26 Tahoe?](https://nodeweekly.com/link/174915/0a4070b383 "github.com") — There were a variety of reports and discussions on social media about system-wide sluggishness caused by changes in a _private_ API in macOS that Electron uses. The good news? The [recently released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/174916/0a4070b383) Electron 38.2, 37.6 and 36.9.2 fix the bug, if you maintain an Electron powered app you need to repackage.
