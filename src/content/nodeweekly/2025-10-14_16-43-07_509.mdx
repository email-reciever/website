[Bun 1.3: The Alternative Full-Stack JavaScript Runtime](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175548/0a4070b383 "bun.sh") — Bun is a JavaScriptCore-powered runtime built with performance and elegance in mind. It can now largely act as a drop-in replacement for Node in many situations, and v1.3 makes it more of a ‘full-stack runtime’ with a built-in dev server (with hot reloading), MySQL/Postgres/SQLite/Redis clients, strong WebSocket support, [isolated package installs](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175549/0a4070b383) by default, and [huge enhancements to its Node.js compatibility](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175550/0a4070b383), particularly around `worker_threads`.

The Bun Team

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [Node.js v24.10.0 (Current)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175551/0a4070b383) has been released – though it's quite a minor release, focused on dependency updates and bug fixes.
    
*   🔒 A reminder that [GitHub is making changes to strengthen npm security](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175552/0a4070b383) that could affect you if you publish packages (_especially_ if you're using classic tokens for npm).
    
*   Pavel Romanov has put together [a helpful guide to using TypeScript with Node.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175583/0a4070b383) Not just in the modern 'type stripping' way, but working with Node's type definitions and the broader ecosystem of tools, along with some limitations you might encounter.
    

[Node.js 20+ Memory Management in Containers](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175553/0a4070b383 "developers.redhat.com") — _“This article answers the question: Do you need to set the heap size in Node.js, or is it already container-aware?”_

De Melo Jnr. and Ayala (Red Hat)

[Generate PDFs from JSON with Python](https://nodeweekly.com/link/175554/0a4070b383 "developer-api.foxit.com") — Build PDFs dynamically using Word templates and JSON data. Fast setup, free Foxit API account included.
