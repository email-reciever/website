This can help avoid malicious versions of packages which are quickly withdrawn.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   ⚠️ Last week we featured news of [a significant npm supply chain attack](https://nodeweekly.com/link/174294/0a4070b383) relating to a variety of popular packages, but yet more are continuing to occur, [this time affecting @ctrl/tinycolor](https://nodeweekly.com/link/174295/0a4070b383) among others. The payload in this case is particularly dangerous as it installed a secrets scanner and exfiltrated the tokens found. [More technical details here.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/174296/0a4070b383)
    
*   [Electron 38 has been released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/174297/0a4070b383) and upgrades to [Node 22.18](https://nodeweekly.com/link/174298/0a4070b383) meaning it gets type stripping enabled by default. It also upgrades from Chromium 138 to 140 (admittedly a rather minor update for devs).
    
*   📗 Flavio Copes has [updated his popular Node.js Handbook](https://nodeweekly.com/link/174299/0a4070b383), originally released in 2018, in a new 2025 edition. It remains free, though behind an email wall.
