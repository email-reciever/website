[Fastify + React – 7x Faster than Next.js?](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168048/0a4070b383 "hire.jonasgalvez.com.br") — Node’s [Fastify](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168049/0a4070b383) framework has a mature plugin for Vite integration ([explained in detail here](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168050/0a4070b383)), including [@fastify/react](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168051/0a4070b383) which [just hit version 1.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168051/0a4070b383) and makes it easy to create fast, featureful (though obviously less so than Next.js) React apps atop Fastify. How fast? Very, it seems.

*   [ESLint has added support for 'bulk suppressions'](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168054/0a4070b383), a way to make adopting stricter linting rules more manageable.
    
*   If you had problems with npm late last week, the npm registry [accidentally wiped everyone's access tokens.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168055/0a4070b383) The incident, [rounded up here](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168056/0a4070b383), is now over and everything should be working again.
    
*   [Bun 1.2.9](https://nodeweekly.com/link/168057/0a4070b383) has been released. As usual, the alternative JS runtime continues to enhance its Node.js compatibility.
