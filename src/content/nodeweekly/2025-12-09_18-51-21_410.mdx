🗓️ A quick notice that **Node Weekly will be moving to Thursdays in January 2026,** as part of a schedule reshuffle for most of [our newsletters](https://cooperpress.com/publications/). We still have one more week before the Christmas break, though, so we'll be back next Tuesday with our 2025 roundup!

[How We're Protecting Our Newsroom from npm Supply Chain Attacks](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178141/0a4070b383 "pnpm.io") — A software engineer at the _Seattle Times_ explains how the paper has been trialing [pnpm](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178142/0a4070b383) as an alternative to `npm` specifically because of its client-side security controls. This isn’t a formal case study but breaks down the technical details well and could give your own team food for thought.

⚠️  [Node.js December 15, 2025 Security Releases](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178143/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — New releases of Node’s v25.x, 24.x, 22.x, and 20.x release lines are expected next Monday, or shortly thereafter, to address five security vulnerabilities (three with ‘high’ severity). We’ll share an update in next Tuesday’s issue.

[Progress on TypeScript 7](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178146/0a4070b383 "devblogs.microsoft.com") — v6.0 is going to be TypeScript’s [last JavaScript-based release](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178147/0a4070b383) and will act as a stepping stone to [the native Go port](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178148/0a4070b383) that will be the eventual v7.0 which is already shaping up to be some 10x faster.

[How We Made `@platformatic/kafka` 223% Faster](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178149/0a4070b383 "blog.platformatic.dev") — Platformatic’s [Kafka client](https://nodeweekly.com/link/178150/0a4070b383) was created last year as the existing options at the time had various compatibility and performance issues, but Platformatic wanted _even more_ performance..
