**IN BRIEF:**

*   **To LTS or not to LTS?** There's a quirk right now where no LTS release of Node.js is designated 'active' while we await the imminent release of a new version of v24. This quirk [caused Node's downloads page to break last week](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176157/0a4070b383). As a fix, [Node v24.10.0](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176158/0a4070b383) is now offered as the active LTS release, though that version was released as 'current' (the role now taken by [v25](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176159/0a4070b383)).
    
*   Lizz Parody shares [a quick update on the state of the Express.js project](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176160/0a4070b383) and its recent steps forward.

[What I Learned Porting Mastro from Deno to Node](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176164/0a4070b383 "mastrojs.github.io") — [Mastro](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176165/0a4070b383) is a web framework and site generator originally for [Deno](https://nodeweekly.com/link/176166/0a4070b383) only. But if Deno is compatible with Node, is it easy to make Deno-facing code run on Node too? Not exactly, but it’s do-able!
