[Read on the Web](https://nodeweekly.com/issues/590)

☀️ I'm back from a week's vacation to find that the biggest Node story on social media is something we featured _two weeks ago_, namely that [Node.js v22.18.0 (LTS) can now run TypeScript](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172956/0a4070b383) (sort of! – it uses type stripping) without a flag 😅 Nonetheless, we still have a good issue for you today, but if you missed our previous issue, [you can find it here.](https://nodeweekly.com/issues/589)

[Node.js v24.6.0 (Current) Released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172962/0a4070b383 "nodejs.org") — A relatively minor step forward. Node 24.6 lets you use your system’s trusted certificates by setting the `NODE_USE_SYSTEM_CA` environment variable (a la `--use-system-ca`), `zlib` adds Zstd dictionary support, and `http` adds a `keepAliveTimeoutBuffer` option for servers.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   👋 The official Node site now [has a page explaining the 'End of Life' (EOL) process](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172963/0a4070b383), what things can break when a version goes EOL, and the current status of different Node versions.
    
*   If you have many Node projects hosted on Vercel and have been dreading upgrading each app one-by-one, [you can now bulk upgrade deprecated Node.js versions on Vercel.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172964/0a4070b383)
    
*   [Oxlint now has type-aware linting in preview.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172965/0a4070b383)
    

[Express App Support Coming to Cloudflare Workers](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172966/0a4070b383 "jross.me") — While there are now things like [Hono](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172967/0a4070b383) for quickly building Express-like webapps across runtimes, [Express](https://nodeweekly.com/link/172968/0a4070b383) nonetheless maintains its position as the most popular option for now. So it’s great to see edge platform Cloudflare Workers adding direct support for it – though it’s local dev only for now.
