## Cool Bits

1.  [Zig migrated from GitHub to Codeberg](https://click.kit-mail6.com/r8u7647ndptoh3nvrw4i2hdolgz66h7h4n26/3ohphdu3zx8v7ksr/aHR0cHM6Ly96aWdsYW5nLm9yZy9uZXdzL21pZ3JhdGluZy1mcm9tLWdpdGh1Yi10by1jb2RlYmVyZy8=) for a mixture of political reasons (totally fair) and frustrations with “inexcusable bugs.” Codeberg rewarded their trust by promptly getting [hit with a DDoS attack](https://click.kit-mail6.com/r8u7647ndptoh3nvrw4i2hdolgz66h7h4n26/n2hohquvr24e34t6/aHR0cHM6Ly9zb2NpYWwuYW5veGlub24uZGUvQENvZGViZXJnLzExNTY1MjI4OTk0OTk2NTkyNQ==) and going down for a while (not cool, Satya).
    
2.  Right on cue, Sinclair Target shared some [thoughts on Go vs. Rust vs. Zig](https://click.kit-mail6.com/r8u7647ndptoh3nvrw4i2hdolgz66h7h4n26/48hvh7umgw3krofx/aHR0cHM6Ly9zaW5jbGFpcnRhcmdldC5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDI1LzA4L3Rob3VnaHRzLW9uLWdvLXZzLi1ydXN0LXZzLi16aWcv).
    
3.  Most AI projects fail during implementation – which is why Augment Code created this [Guide to Closing the Enterprise AI Failure Rate Gap](https://click.kit-mail6.com/r8u7647ndptoh3nvrw4i2hdolgz66h7h4n26/wnh2h6uqgmd8q9i7/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYW5kZi5jby80ckRpTjVh). It provides the specific infrastructure patterns, monitoring architectures, and deployment strategies that actually work at scale. \[sponsored\]
    
4.  Critical security vulnerabilities are becoming super trendy these days, and the React Team just announced their own [unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in RSC](https://click.kit-mail6.com/r8u7647ndptoh3nvrw4i2hdolgz66h7h4n26/reh8h9umxkpnm2c2/aHR0cHM6Ly9yZWFjdC5kZXYvYmxvZy8yMDI1LzEyLzAzL2NyaXRpY2FsLXNlY3VyaXR5LXZ1bG5lcmFiaWxpdHktaW4tcmVhY3Qtc2VydmVyLWNvbXBvbmVudHM=). You should upgrade your React projects asap – unless you were too lazy to upgrade to React 19 in the first place. Then you’re good.

6.  Daniel Rosenwasser shared an update on [TypeScript 7](https://click.kit-mail6.com/r8u7647ndptoh3nvrw4i2hdolgz66h7h4n26/8ghqh3uo9w8ko3hk/aHR0cHM6Ly9kZXZibG9ncy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL3R5cGVzY3JpcHQvcHJvZ3Jlc3Mtb24tdHlwZXNjcmlwdC03LWRlY2VtYmVyLTIwMjUv). It’s codenamed _Project Corsa,_ but it should hopefully run a lot better than the Vauxhall Corsa I rented last time I went to London.
    
7.  [CarbonQA](https://click.kit-mail6.com/r8u7647ndptoh3nvrw4i2hdolgz66h7h4n26/vqh3hmuogm68o3ug/aHR0cHM6Ly9jYXJib25xYS5jb20vP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1jb29sX2JpdHMmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZGVjNSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Ynl0ZXM=) provides high-quality QA services for dev teams, so you’ll never have to waste time testing your own app again. Their US-based testers work in your tools, talk with your team on Slack, and let your devs spend their time building real features. \[sponsored\]
    
8.  Zach Leatherman wrote some security suggestions for [locking down your npm publishing workflows](https://click.kit-mail6.com/r8u7647ndptoh3nvrw4i2hdolgz66h7h4n26/l2heh6ulrqpwlzb6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuemFjaGxlYXQuY29tL3dlYi9ucG0tc2VjdXJpdHkv). So maybe you can help prevent _Shai Halud 3: The Return of the Worm_ from infecting an npm package near you.
