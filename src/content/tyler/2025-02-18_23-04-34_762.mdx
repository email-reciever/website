## Cool Bits

1.

It uses TanStack Router and _Vite_ to give you a clean and simple SPA setup ‚Äì but if the React team asks, you didn‚Äôt hear about it from us ü§´.

You can also self-host it now too ‚Äì so there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from keeping all your data in a 37-tab Notion doc. \[sponsored\]

## Pop Quiz: Answer

#### Sponsored by [Retool‚Äôs livestream](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/4zum43m267behppnqzvuqu6g9z777s5/g3hnhwu3vqwegqbr/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldmVudHMucmV0b29sLmNvbS9haS1tb2RlbHM_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWJ5dGVfZGV2JnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWJ5dGVfZGV2)

What will be logged to the console when this code executes?

```js
window.name = "Mike Tyson";

const me = &lcub;
  name: "Tyler",
  sayName() &lcub;
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

const sayName = me.sayName;
sayName();
```

The answer? ‚ÄúMike Tyson‚Äù.

Since we‚Äôre not in strict mode, `sayName` isn‚Äôt a method, and we‚Äôre not using `call` or `apply`, `this` inside of `sayName` will default to the `window` object.

‚Äúwho uses the ‚Äòthis‚Äô keyword anymore??‚Äù ya ya
