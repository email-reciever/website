## Cool Bits

1.  The Safari team just unveiled [Item Flow](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quoleoxr2s7hn080dzu7u95qqv44in/m2h7h6u3gd80lrcm/aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWJraXQub3JnL2Jsb2cvMTY1ODcvaXRlbS1mbG93LXBhcnQtMS1hLW5ldy11bmlmaWVkLWNvbmNlcHQtZm9yLWxheW91dC8=), a new concept for layout that would incorporate Grid, Masonry, and Flexbox into one unified set of properties. I’m told it has nothing to do with that creepy cat movie that won the Best Animated Film Oscar.
    
2.  Datadog created this [Digital Experience Monitoring Solution Brief](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quoleoxr2s7hn080dzu7u95qqv44in/dphehmue4l0wxzbm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGF0YWRvZ2hxLmNvbS9yZXNvdXJjZXMvZGlnaXRhbC1leHBlcmllbmNlLW1vbml0b3Jpbmctc29sdXRpb24tYnJpZWYvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1kZy1hcG0td3ctZGVtLWJyaWVmLWJ5dGVzJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWJ5dGVzZGV2), which shows you how to use Datadog as the single source of truth for all your frontend monitoring data – and simplify how your team runs tests and fixes issues. \[sponsored\]

7.  [Anime.js just released v4 of its animation library](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quoleoxr2s7hn080dzu7u95qqv44in/p8hehqu43nz5elsq/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmltZWpzLmNvbS8=) with a new modular API, big perf upgrades, scroll-linked animations, and lots more.
