## Cool Bits

1.  The WebKit team just released [CSS Grid Lanes](https://click.kit-mail6.com/v8ul8gl7wdbrhv8664ktghv3e98lls9hq32o/e0hph0u75594m9b8/aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWJraXQub3JnL2Jsb2cvMTc2NjAvaW50cm9kdWNpbmctY3NzLWdyaWQtbGFuZXMv), which it calls “the future of masonry layouts on the web.” I also recently spoke about “the future of masonry” at my local lodge meeting, but they cut me off halfway through my pitch on how Masonic NFTs could use the blockchain to verify who is a true brother.
    
2.  Go beyond IDEs with [Tonkotsu’s desktop app](https://click.kit-mail6.com/v8ul8gl7wdbrhv8664ktghv3e98lls9hq32o/7qh7h2u933vzdktz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9ua290c3UuYWkvYmV5b25kaWRlcz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249MTIzMCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWJ5dGVz). It’s disciplined, multi-agent engineering built for professionals. Build a thorough technical plan, then delegate coding to a team of agents. Pretty slick. \[sponsored\]
    
3.  Nick Miller wrote an in-depth breakdown on [static allocation with Zig](https://click.kit-mail6.com/v8ul8gl7wdbrhv8664ktghv3e98lls9hq32o/owhkhwuw553ox6bv/aHR0cHM6Ly9uaWNrbW9uYWQuYmxvZy8yMDI1L3N0YXRpYy1hbGxvY2F0aW9uLXdpdGgtemlnLWt2Lw==), based on his work on his [key/value store](https://click.kit-mail6.com/v8ul8gl7wdbrhv8664ktghv3e98lls9hq32o/z2hgh7ue009w57tp/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL25pY2ttb25hZC9rdg==). And I must say, it’s nice to see him doing so well after getting his heart broken by Jess after she moved out of the loft.
    
4.  [Waku released a v1.0 alpha](https://click.kit-mail6.com/v8ul8gl7wdbrhv8664ktghv3e98lls9hq32o/p8hehqu488kxr5aq/aHR0cHM6Ly93YWt1LmdnL2Jsb2cvd2FrdS12MS1hbHBoYQ==) of its minimal React framework with full RSC support.
    
5.  [The Concise TypeScript book](https://click.kit-mail6.com/v8ul8gl7wdbrhv8664ktghv3e98lls9hq32o/x0hph3uexx83kls5/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2dpYmJvay90eXBlc2NyaXB0LWJvb2s=) is a free and open-source guide to TypeScript that was recently updated and proves that the word “concise” can mean different things to different people.
    
6.  Kieran Gill wrote about how [nobody really knows how to scale LLMs to larger codebases](https://click.kit-mail6.com/v8ul8gl7wdbrhv8664ktghv3e98lls9hq32o/6qhehoul00vox2ho/aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmtpZXJhbmdpbGwueHl6L292ZXJzaWdodC1hbmQtZ3VpZGFuY2U=) – but he has a few theories on what we should try next.

Used by projects like Bun, Vue, Nix, and 100k+ others to ship better code. \[sponsored\]
    
8.  Una Kravets wrote about [directional CSS with the `scrolled` state query](https://click.kit-mail6.com/v8ul8gl7wdbrhv8664ktghv3e98lls9hq32o/58hvh8ugllp73mh6/aHR0cHM6Ly91bmEuaW0vc2Nyb2xsLXN0YXRlLXNjcm9sbGVk).

10.  A group of 16-year-olds [pwned Twitter, Vercel, Cursor, and Discord with a supply-chain attack](https://click.kit-mail6.com/v8ul8gl7wdbrhv8664ktghv3e98lls9hq32o/qvh8h8udqqgneoul/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXN0LmdpdGh1Yi5jb20vaGFja2VybW9uZGV2LzVlMmNkYzMyODQ5NDA1ZmZmNmI0Njk1Nzc0N2EyZDI4) by exposing some critical vulnerabilities on Mintlify, an AI documentation platform. But they promised not to expose any customer data as long as an adult bought them some watermelon vapes and _Magic: The Gathering_ cards. Merry Christmas, my little gremlins.
