## Pop Quiz: Answer

#### Sponsored by [Depot](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh24kvlzirh4ldgonns7h4oml/reh8h9umwvd586u2/aHR0cHM6Ly9iaXQubHkvM0o2TkE5bQ==)

What gets logged?

```js
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) &lcub;
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000)
}
```

A little throw back for all you old heads. This used to be everyone’s favorite JavaScript interview question.

This code will log `5` 5 times.

The reason for this is because we declared our variable with `var`, which is function scoped. By the time our functions given to `setTimeout` run, `i` will already be `5` and every function will reference that same variable. To fix this, use `let` which is block scoped and will give each iteration of our for loop its own `i`.

```js
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) &lcub;
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000)
}
```
