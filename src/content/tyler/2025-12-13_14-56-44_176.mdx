## Cool Bits

1.  shadcn (the Satoshi of web dev) just launched [shadcn/create](https://click.kit-mail6.com/0vuvlov37di9h9qg60vilhvzgdx55snhnvdl/dphehmue5plvg4am/aHR0cHM6Ly91aS5zaGFkY24uY29tLw==) – which lets you build your own shadcn/ui by picking your own component library, icons, base color, fonts, etc, so you can “build something that doesn’t look like everything else.”
    
2.  [MongoDB Skill Badges](https://click.kit-mail6.com/0vuvlov37di9h9qg60vilhvzgdx55snhnvdl/e0hph0u74r86glt8/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYW5kZi5jby80b0RKOE5Y) are free, focused courses and credentials that help you quickly learn and validate specific MongoDB skills – like Advanced Schema Design Patterns, CRUD Operations, Networking Security, and more. \[sponsored\]
    
3.  Former React team member, Christoph Nakazawa just released [fate](https://click.kit-mail6.com/0vuvlov37di9h9qg60vilhvzgdx55snhnvdl/7qh7h2u9znrq78fz/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL25renctdGVjaC9mYXRl) – a modern data client for React and tRPC that’s inspired by Relay and GraphQL and will finally solve all of your data fetching problems forever. Probably.

The last time I “targeted a child” was with my water balloon launcher when I found those kids TP’ing my house on Halloween, so my expectations are high.

6.  Frederik Braun explained [why the Sanitizer API is just `setHTML()` with better branding](https://click.kit-mail6.com/0vuvlov37di9h9qg60vilhvzgdx55snhnvdl/p8hehqu4xqnm07tq/aHR0cHM6Ly9mcmVkZXJpa2JyYXVuLmRlL3doeS1zZXRodG1sLmh0bWw=).

Disturbingly accurate, but the overall tone wasn’t _quite_ condescending enough.
