## Pop Quiz: Answer

#### Sponsored by [Zed](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xndrkaqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/3ohphdu3znom62ir/aHR0cHM6Ly96ZWQuZGV2L2Jsb2cvYWdlbnQtZXh0ZW5zaW9ucw==)

How can we improve this code?

```js
async function completeCheckout(orderId) &lcub;
  await updateAnalytics(orderId);
  const order = await processOrder(orderId);

  return order;
}
```

Because `processOrder` doesn’t depend on the result of `updateAnalytics`, we can parallelize the two invocations.

```js
async function completeCheckout(orderId) &lcub;
  const [_, order] = await Promise.all([
    updateAnalytics(orderId),
    processOrder(orderId)
  ])

  return order;
}
```
