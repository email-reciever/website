If I knew anything about F1 racing, I would make a joke here about how they should use Rust to beat Ferrari and make Lewis Hamilton jealous?

Check out the [30-day free trial](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quoleoxr2s7hn9p520s7u9m8n444tnhxdov/wnh2h6uqvrmz6lf7/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJpY2guaW8vP3JlZj1ieXRlcw==) to see why it’s loved by developers. \[sponsored\]

It’s a web-based, real-time code-breaking game with a terminal-style UI – like playing Battleship in The Matrix.

6.  The [Lingo.dev Compiler](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quoleoxr2s7hn9p520s7u9m8n444tnhxdov/8ghqh3uopgw4vehk/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5nby5kZXYvZW4vY29tcGlsZXI=) is an open-source, AI-powered compiler that can instantly translate any React app without rewriting the existing React components.
    
7.  The [Nuxt v4 alpha](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quoleoxr2s7hn9p520s7u9m8n444tnhxdov/vqh3hmuo3nm57xug/aHR0cHM6Ly9udXh0LmNvbS9ibG9nL3JvYWRtYXAtdjQ=) just came out with a new directory structure, improved data fetching, and more. `Nuxt Alpha` is my gamertag on all the Matrix Battleship forums.
    
8.  Matteo Collina and his team created a new Node.js module called [php-node](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quoleoxr2s7hn9p520s7u9m8n444tnhxdov/l2heh6ulvoqg9ni6/aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLnBsYXRmb3JtYXRpYy5kZXYvc2VhbWxlc3NseS1ibGVuZC1waHAtd2l0aC1ub2RlanM=) that lets you run PHP apps in a Node environment. Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.
