## Pop Quiz: Answer

#### Sponsored by [Orkes’ MCP Workbench](https://c5e21242.click.convertkit-mail.com/68u0wq06r5a8h5zm0p7aohp0g35qlt9hlqvo/m2h7h6u3vwqe02um/aHR0cHM6Ly9vcmtlcy5pby9ibG9nL21jcC13b3JrYmVuY2gtcHJvdG9jb2wtZGVidWdnZXIv)

How would you remove the duplicate elements from this array?

```js
const list = [
  &lcub; name: 'John' }, 
  &lcub; name: 'Sara' },
  &lcub; name: 'Sara' },
  &lcub; name: 'Lynn' },
  &lcub; name: 'Jake' }
];
```

There are a few ways to do this. Your first intuition might be to do something like this.

```js
const uniqueList = Array.from(new Set(list))
```

It’s the right idea since creating a `Set` will ensure our collection only contains _unique_ values and `Array.from` allows us to create a new, shallow-copied array. Unfortunately, `Sets` only enforce uniqueness for primitive values, but our list is full of objects.

Instead, we can do something like this.

```js
const map = new Map();

list.forEach(item => &lcub;
  map.set(item.name, item)
});

const uniqueList = Array.from(map.values())
```

Notice we’re using a `Map` here. Since `Map`s preserve insertion order, our `uniqueList` will have the same order as the original list, but without the duplicates since we’re using `name` as the key.

Another fancy approach is using `filter` with `findIndex`,

```js
const uniqueList = list.filter((item, index) => 
  list.findIndex((&lcub;name}) => 
    name === item.name
  ) === index
);
```

Or using `.reduce` and `.map`,

```js
const uniqueList = Object.keys(
  list.reduce((acc, cur) => &lcub;
    acc[cur.name] = cur.name;
    return acc;
  }, &lcub;}),
).map((name) => (&lcub; name }));
```

Or one of the other various ways that I’m sure you’ll all let me know about 🫶.

There are a few ways to do this. Your first intuition might be to do something like this.

```js
const uniqueList = Array.from(new Set(list))

It’s the right idea since creating a `Set` will ensure our collection only contains *unique* values and `Array.from` allows us to create a new, shallow-copied array. Unfortunately, `Sets` only enforce uniqueness for primitive values, but our list is full of objects.

Instead, we can do something like this.

```js
const map = new Map();

list.forEach(item => &lcub;
