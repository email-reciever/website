## Cool Bits

1.  Cloudflare CEO, Matthew Prince wrote a debrief on Tuesday’s [massive outage](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xmdomsqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/m2h7h6u3mrd04ecm/aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNsb3VkZmxhcmUuY29tLzE4LW5vdmVtYmVyLTIwMjUtb3V0YWdlLw==). I was a _little_ surprised when he blamed everything on Rust furries developers, but I’m sure his crisis PR team had their reasons.
    
2.  GitHub is [removing all toasts from their UI](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xmdomsqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/e0hph0u7qx8wrmc8/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcmltZXIuc3R5bGUvYWNjZXNzaWJpbGl0eS90b2FzdHMv) because of the accessibility and usability issues.
    
3.  [Zed’s next-gen code editor](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xmdomsqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/7qh7h2u9wgrpnqbz/aHR0cHM6Ly96ZWQuZGV2Lw==) is shockingly fast and designed for smooth collaboration with AI and other humans. It’s written from scratch in Rust (not Electron 🙏), lets you chat and work with teammates, and integrates LLMs into your workflow in helpful ways. \[sponsored\]
    
4.  TkDodo wrote about how [tooltip components should not exist](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xmdomsqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/owhkhwuwgz2lq9sv/aHR0cHM6Ly90a2RvZG8uZXUvYmxvZy90b29sdGlwLWNvbXBvbmVudHMtc2hvdWxkLW5vdC1leGlzdA==). So if you enjoy tooltips and/or toasts, just make sure you’ve got a solid safehouse when the great UI Purge begins.
    
5.  Chrome DevTools released a [new CDP editor](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xmdomsqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/z2hgh7uepgqrlxfp/aHR0cHM6Ly9kZXZlbG9wZXIuY2hyb21lLmNvbS9ibG9nL2NkcC1jb21tYW5kLWVkaXRvcg==) that makes it easier to write Chrome DevTools Protocol commands.

Just set up one single Auth0 integration, and everything _just works_. \[sponsored\]
    
7.  Remix maintainer, Pedro Cattori wrote about [what “Just JavaScript” means to him](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xmdomsqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/x0hph3ue9g5dqvc5/aHR0cHM6Ly9wZWRyb2NhdHRvcmkuY29tL3Bvc3RzL2p1c3QtamF2YXNjcmlwdC8=) – aka my favorite Stevie Wonder Christmas song.
    
8.  Anthropic wrote about [building more efficient agents with MCP](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xmdomsqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/6qhehoulnqm69mao/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW50aHJvcGljLmNvbS9lbmdpbmVlcmluZy9jb2RlLWV4ZWN1dGlvbi13aXRoLW1jcA==). Some are calling this an admission of defeat on how they’ve implemented MCP so far, but I won’t do that because I want Dario to give me thousands of stock options to be his yes man to be a nice guy.
    
9.

10.  dvcrn has been thinking way too hard about [Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnels](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xmdomsqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/58hvh8ugkero64t6/aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXZpZC5jb2ZmZWUvY2xvdWRmbGFyZS16ZXJvLXRydXN0LXR1bm5lbHM=), and yes, I realize that this week isn’t the best time to be using the words “Cloudflare” and “Zero Trust” in the same sentence but here we are.
    
11.  Aiden Bai created [React Grab](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xmdomsqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/25h2h9u345k0mxa3/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2FpZGVueWJhaS9yZWFjdC1ncmFi), a `&lt;script>` tag that lets you grab any element in your app and give it to your coding agent.
    
12.  Karboosx’s tutorial on [building your own simple search engine](https://click.kit-mail6.com/p9unqxnv5mt9h2xmdomsqhpd0l033hrhg6ep/qvh8h8udox92kxul/aHR0cHM6Ly9rYXJib29zeC5uZXQvcG9zdC80ZVp4aEJvbi9idWlsZGluZy1hLXNpbXBsZS1zZWFyY2gtZW5naW5lLXRoYXQtYWN0dWFsbHktd29ya3M=) means you no longer have to rely on Elasticsearch or Algolia. It also means you’re just one VS Code fork away from creating the next Google.

## Pop Quiz: Answer

Whenever you ask “how could this code be improved?”, you open the (email) floodgate. But…

One way is that instead of waiting for the image to load before fetching the metadata, we can start fetching the metadata immediately by moving the fetch call outside of the onload handler. This will allow the metadata to load in parallel with the image.

```js
document.getElementById("thumbnail").addEventListener("click", () => &lcub;
  const metadataPromise = fetch("path_to_metadata_API").then((res) =>
    res.json()
  );

  const img = new Image();
  img.src = "path_to_high_res_image.jpg";
  document.getElementById("gallery").appendChild(img);

  img.onload = async () => &lcub;
    const metadata = await metadataPromise;
    document.getElementById("metadata").innerText = metadata.description;
  };
});
```
