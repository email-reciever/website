## Pop Quiz: Answer

#### Sponsored by [Clerk](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/27ur84roxvioh82m5kgh3hgqnd444hghm2v3/reh8h9umqgk69nf2/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5jbGVyay5jb20vZ0E4SVVQTg==)

What gets logged?

```js
let sharedVariable = "initial";

setTimeout(() => &lcub;
  sharedVariable = "updated by first timeout";
}, 500);

setTimeout(() => &lcub;
  if (sharedVariable === "initial") &lcub;
    console.log("Shared variable not yet updated");
  } else &lcub;
    console.log("Shared variable was already updated");
  }
}, 500);
```

In JavaScript, the execution order for `setTimeout` callbacks with identical delays aren‚Äôt deterministic. This means we aren‚Äôt guaranteed that the first timeout callback will execute first (which can be the cause of some nasty and difficult to reproduce bugs). In reality it‚Äôs almost always what you‚Äôd expect (‚ÄúShared variable was already updated‚Äù), but it‚Äôs best not to rely on that behavior.

Here‚Äôs a [famous talk](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/27ur84roxvioh82m5kgh3hgqnd444hghm2v3/kkhmh2un8kzxd5hl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj04YUdoWlFrb0ZiUQ==) by Philip Roberts to learn more about the event loop and how JavaScript handles asynchronous code.
