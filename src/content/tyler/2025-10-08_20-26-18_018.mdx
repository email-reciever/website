## Cool Bits

1.  [The React Foundation](https://click.kit-mail6.com/o8u9gp9876sqh6g6496bvhq4dm8rrcoh4g6l/kkhmh2unn8lz57al/aHR0cHM6Ly9yZWFjdC5kZXYvYmxvZy8yMDI1LzEwLzA3L2ludHJvZHVjaW5nLXRoZS1yZWFjdC1mb3VuZGF0aW9u) was just announced as the new home for React, and Zuck has personally reassigned the React team to content moderation duty for the new _Vibes_ feed.
    
2.  They announced a bunch of other stuff at React Conf so far (here’s the [Day 1 livestream](https://click.kit-mail6.com/o8u9gp9876sqh6g6496bvhq4dm8rrcoh4g6l/58hvh8ugg5m30pu6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj16eVZSZzJRUjZMQQ==)), and I promise we’ll write a full rundown when the dust settles.
    
3.  [Zed is a next-gen code editor](https://click.kit-mail6.com/o8u9gp9876sqh6g6496bvhq4dm8rrcoh4g6l/25h2h9u3372lgvu3/aHR0cHM6Ly96ZWQuZGV2Lz91dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1ieXRlcw==) that’s fast (written in Rust) and has a bunch of cool features (debugger, AI agent editing, native git support, lots more). We’ve written about it in the past because it’s a really cool project, and you should check it out. \[sponsored\]
    
4.  shadcn (the component collection) just launched [a bunch of new components](https://click.kit-mail6.com/o8u9gp9876sqh6g6496bvhq4dm8rrcoh4g6l/qvh8h8udd8rev4tl/aHR0cHM6Ly94LmNvbS9zaGFkY24vc3RhdHVzLzE5NzQxNjEzNDQ0OTM2NzA2ODc=) for shadcn button groups, fields, input groups, empty states, and more. shadcn (the person) is probably the OSS maintainer that’s most capable of starting a cult of devoted followers within the next five years. Personally, I can’t wait to serve our fearless leader.

They share how their engineering teams are getting the most value out of AI in their day-to-day work, and where it still falls short. \[sponsored\]

10.
