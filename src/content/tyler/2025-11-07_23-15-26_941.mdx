## Pop Quiz: Answer

#### Sponsored by [Sentry](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh2zr4epurh4qpepnns7h4oml/m2h7h6u3meelnnsm/aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLnNlbnRyeS5pby9haS1jb2RlLXJldmlldy0zMGstYnVncy1saWdodGVyLTUwLWZhc3Rlci8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWFpY29kZXJldmlldy1meTI2cTQtYWljb2RlcmV2aWV3bGF1bmNoJnV0bV9jb250ZW50PW5ld3NsZXR0ZXItMzBrLWJsb2ctbGVhcm5tb3JlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cGFpZC1jb21tdW5pdHkmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1ieXRlcw==)

```js
let i = 0

function x() &lcub;
  i++
  return 10
}

i += x()

console.log(i) // ?
```

The answer is `10`. Here’s how it works.

For clarity, we can refactor `i += x()` to be `i = i + x()`. From there, the interpreter begins evaluating our code. Before it evaluates the function invocation, it seems that `i` evaluates to `0`, so now our code is `i = 0 + x()`. The invocation of `x` returns `10`, so now it’s `i = 0 + 10`, which gives us `i = 10`.

Note that if you swap the order of `i` and `x()` like `i = x() + i` you get a different value - 🫂.
