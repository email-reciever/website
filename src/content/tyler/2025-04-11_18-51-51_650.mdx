## Cool Bits

2.  [Waku v0.22](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/r8u7647ndptoh3784m4c6udrvvz66f7/n2hohquvxxe3mlf6/aHR0cHM6Ly93YWt1LmdnL2Jsb2cvYXBpLXJvdXRlcw==) is a major re-architecture for the React framework, and it now supports API routes.
    
3.  Augment Code just launched [the first coding agent for large codebases](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/r8u7647ndptoh3784m4c6udrvvz66f7/48hvh7umppkrv3fx/aHR0cHM6Ly9mbmYuZGV2LzRpalFjZzg=).
