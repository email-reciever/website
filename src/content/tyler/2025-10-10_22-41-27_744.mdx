## Cool Bits

1.  CultRepo’s new [Vite documentary](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/qvh8h8udddrw3ptl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1ibVdRcUFLTGdUNA==) just dropped, and I must say that all of the love scenes were very tastefully done.
    
2.  Tuple created the [screen sharing tool for developers](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/g3hnhwummm3925ar/aHR0cHM6Ly90dXBsZS5hcHAvbC9wYWlyLXByb2dyYW1taW5nP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1ieXRlc19zZWNvbmRhcnlfMjAyNTEwMDkmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Ynl0ZXM=) that Shopify, Stripe, and Tailwind use for pair programming, getting unblocked, and making technical decisions. Shared control by default, intuitive annotations, and no persistent UI elements that block the IDE. \[sponsored\]
    
3.  React Native turned 10 years old and celebrated at React Conf by releasing [React Native 0.82](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/9qhzhdudddpw8vs9/aHR0cHM6Ly9yZWFjdG5hdGl2ZS5kZXYvYmxvZy8yMDI1LzEwLzA4L3JlYWN0LW5hdGl2ZS0wLjgy), which ends support for the old architecture and introduces DOM Node APIs. It was a lot like my 10th birthday, just with less cigarettes and more father figures present.
    
4.  [Next.js 16 beta](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/3ohphdu3337m8ear/aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXh0anMub3JnL2Jsb2cvbmV4dC0xNi1iZXRh) came out yesterday, because the triangle mafia couldn’t wait to upstage all the React Native speakers.
    
5.  [Bun v1.3](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/n2hohquvvv3q47t6/aHR0cHM6Ly9idW4uY29tL2Jsb2cvYnVuLXYxLjM=) just dropped today and it’s their “biggest release yet.” My eyes are still glazed over from running the React Conf marathon, but we’ll dig into this next week.
    
6.  [css-extras](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/48hvh7ummmrl37ix/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3NpbmRyZXNvcmh1cy9jc3MtZXh0cmFz) is a WIP collection of CSS custom functions that leverage the new native CSS `@function` rule.
    
7.  Convex just released this [TanStack Start Quickstart](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/wnh2h6uqqqw7dds7/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmNvbnZleC5kZXYvcXVpY2tzdGFydC90YW5zdGFjay1zdGFydA==) page in their docs to help you get setup quickly with Convex and TanStack Start v1.0 – the new React framework that all the kids are talking about. \[sponsored\]
    
8.  Kix Panganiban wrote a quick post about [two things LLM coding agents are still bad at](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/reh8h9ummm0dp8t2/aHR0cHM6Ly9raXguZGV2L3R3by10aGluZ3MtbGxtLWNvZGluZy1hZ2VudHMtYXJlLXN0aWxsLWJhZC1hdC8=). Without looking, I’m going to guess they’re referring to
    
9.  Chun Fei Lung wrote about how [Svelte really is that fast](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/08hwhgu222de80hl/aHR0cHM6Ly9jaHVuaXZlcnNpdGVpdC5ubC9wYXBlcnMvc3ZlbHRlLWlzLWZhc3Q=). I think it’s because they used the Svelte Runes to cast a speed spell.
    
10.  CarbonQA provides [high-quality QA services for dev teams](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/8ghqh3uooold40ak/aHR0cHM6Ly9jYXJib25xYS5jb20vP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1jb29sX2JpdHMmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9b2N0MTAmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWJ5dGVz), so your engineers will never have to waste time doing QA ever again. Their US-based testers work directly in your tools, talk with your team on Slack, and let your devs spend their time building real features. \[sponsored\]

12.  Anthropic wrote a pretty interesting paper on how [a small number of samples can poison LLMs of any size](https://click.kit-mail6.com/38u3l732zwhkh249do3crh4ldgonns7h4oml/l2heh6ulll32g4h6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW50aHJvcGljLmNvbS9yZXNlYXJjaC9zbWFsbC1zYW1wbGVzLXBvaXNvbg==). It’s similar to the paper I’m writing about how a small number of neck-beards on Reddit already have poisoned LLMs of various sizes.
