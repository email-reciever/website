## Cool Bits

1.  [TanStack AI (alpha)](https://click.kit-mail6.com/92udw7d2rkanh6np25ou9hzolw633iwhgx86/6qhehoulo85r0vso/aHR0cHM6Ly90YW5zdGFjay5jb20vYmxvZy90YW5zdGFjay1haS1hbHBoYS15b3VyLWFpLXlvdXItd2F5) promises to be a framework-agnostic AI toolkit for developers who want full control of their stack. It comes with server support across multiple languages, adapters for all the LLM providers, and more. Because you can’t spell, “I am Lord Voldemort TanStack” without AI.
    
2.  Our very own Lynn Fisher just released her annual [personal site update](https://click.kit-mail6.com/92udw7d2rkanh6np25ou9hzolw633iwhgx86/e0hph0u743lv5pi8/aHR0cHM6Ly9seW5uYW5kdG9uaWMuY29tLw==), and you’ve never seen a tiny, fixed-width website this beautiful in your life.

You can now securely connect your AI agents to apps and data, control critical actions that agents can perform plus the data they can access, and enable human in the loop confirmation for agent actions.
