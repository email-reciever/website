In this post Krasimir presents Forket, a tool that lets you use React Server Components without Next.js or other frameworks. Forket splits your code into separate client and server versions. It works before your existing build tools, giving you freedom to implement server components in any setup. The tool handles component serialization, hydration, and server actions automatically.

As your app scales, managing roles and permissions gets messy. Hard-coded access slows you down and fails to meet enterprise demands. WorkOS RBAC gives you structured, scalable access control with clean APIs, a powerful dashboard, and built-in single sign-on and automated user provisioning.

[Using activity with suspenseful data](https://reactdigest.net/links/20204/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)

Activity is a new React 19 component that lets you hide and show parts of your app while keeping their data and settings intact. When hidden, components stop running background tasks but continue loading data at lower priority. This is helpful when child components need to control their own visibility based on data that only they can see. It's better than other methods because it keeps component state and preloads data in the background.

_11 minutes_ by Carl Rippon

In this tutorial Carl shows how to build an AI-powered product review analyzer using React 19 and the Vercel AI SDK. You'll create a form where users can paste customer reviews to get sentiment analysis and business insights. The app uses React 19's useActionState hook and Server Functions to handle form submissions and AI processing. It integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model to analyze reviews and return structured JSON responses with sentiment scores and actionable recommendations.

[Deriving client state from server state](https://reactdigest.net/links/20206/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_5 minutes_ by Dominik Dorfmeister

Dominik explores how instead of using useEffect to sync client state with server state, you can derive the state directly. When checking if a selected user ID is still valid, compute the result on the fly rather than updating the stored value. This approach is simpler and gives you more flexibility, like automatically restoring selections when data changes.

Building enterprise applications requires middleware that can handle authentication, data enrichment, and performance optimization while remaining testable and maintainable. Most middleware tutorials show simple examples, but production applications demand sophisticated patterns that can handle complex dependencies, caching strategies, and comprehensive testing.
