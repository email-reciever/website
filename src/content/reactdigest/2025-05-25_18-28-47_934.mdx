[Mastering focus management with flushSync](https://reactdigest.net/links/19302/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_5 minutes_ by Kent C. Dodds

In this article Kent explains how React's flushSync API solves focus management challenges in React applications. Due to React's batched rendering approach, attempting to focus elements immediately after state changes often fails because the DOM hasn't updated yet. flushSync provides a clean solution by forcing React to apply state updates immediately.

[Concurrent Rendering](https://reactdigest.net/links/19304/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_12 minutes_ by Ui

React v18 introduced concurrent rendering, a feature that took the React team over 5 years to develop. This fundamental change allows React to prioritize high-priority tasks over low-priority rendering work by making rendering interruptible. The article explains how this works through APIs like useDeferredValue and startTransition, which help developers create more responsive UIs by allowing React to defer non-urgent updates while prioritizing user interactions.

_less than one hour_ by Jaeuk Lim

Jaeuk brings a hands-on learning project that guides developers through rewriting the popular data-fetching library from scratch. The project covers core components like QueryClient and QueryCache, as well as React-specific hooks including useQuery and developer tools, all aimed at providing deeper understanding of TanStack Query's implementation.

_3 minutes_ by Nir Tamir

Nir discusses limitations of using RSC as a data layer, particularly for implementing infinite scrolling. He presents an approach using useActionState but notes significant drawbacks including blocking server actions and complexity with shared state. After evaluating options, they ultimately migrated to react-query for centralized state management.

Meticulous automatically creates and maintains an exhaustive e2e UI test suite that covers every corner of your application – with no developer intervention required whatsoever. Dropbox, Lattice, Bilt Rewards and hundreds of organisations rely on Meticulous for their frontend testing. It is built from the Chromium level up with a deterministic scheduling engine – making it the only testing tool that eliminates flakes.
