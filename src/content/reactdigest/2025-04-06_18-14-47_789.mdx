[React Architecture Tradeoffs: SPA, SSR, or RSC](https://reactdigest.net/links/18866/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_9 minutes_ by Brad Westfall

In this article Brad discusses React Single Page Applications versus React frameworks with server-side rendering. He highlights the limitations of SPAs and advocates for frameworks like Next.js and React Router Framework that combine the benefits of both SPAs and server-side rendering. These frameworks handle lazy-loading, client-side navigation, and data management, eliminating the need for complex state management solutions while still allowing integration with non-JavaScript backends.

In this post Christian examines how React's memoization tools work under the hood and when they should actually be used. It dispels common misconceptions, particularly that memoizing props automatically prevents child component re-renders, and highlights several pitfalls that can silently break memoization including prop spreading, handling JSX children, and nested memo components. Christian recommends using these tools only after profiling to identify actual performance bottlenecks, suggesting that component composition often presents a more elegant solution than extensive memoization.

[Building Robust React Apps with Zustand and Immer](https://reactdigest.net/links/18869/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_8 minutes_ by Giovanni Crisalfi

Giovanni discusses how he, initially averse to React and JavaScript, has come to appreciate them through libraries like Zustand and Immer. Zustand offers a minimalist state management solution that simplifies Redux's complexities, while Immer elegantly handles immutable state updates, especially for nested data structures. He demonstrates these tools' effectiveness with a canvas application example, showing how they handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations with clean, maintainable code.

[3 ways to build forms in react (without any libraries)](https://reactdigest.net/links/18870/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_3 minutes_ by Corina Udrescu

In this post Corina discusses three approaches to building forms in React without using third-party libraries: uncontrolled inputs using native browser features and FormData, controlled inputs with React state, and the new React 19 action attribute with useActionState. She prefers the uncontrolled inputs approach for simple forms due to its readability and use of native browser features, while noting that the React 19 approach shines for async server actions and SSR implementations.

[Adaptive Video Streaming With Dash.js In React](https://reactdigest.net/links/18871/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_10 minutes_ by Teng Wei Herr

Teng dives deep into how to move beyond the limitations of the standard HTML5 video element by implementing adaptive bitrate streaming. Unlike progressive downloading, adaptive bitrate streaming splits videos into multiple segments at different quality levels, automatically selecting the optimal resolution based on network conditions. He provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide using FFmpeg to transcode videos, generate the necessary manifest files, and implement a DASH-compatible video player in React, enabling smooth video playback even on slower connections or lower-end devices.

Meticulous automatically creates and maintains an exhaustive e2e UI test suite that covers every corner of your application – with no developer intervention required whatsoever. Dropbox, Lattice, Bilt Rewards and hundreds of organisations rely on Meticulous for their frontend testing. It is built from the Chromium level up with a deterministic scheduling engine – making it the only testing tool that eliminates flakes.
