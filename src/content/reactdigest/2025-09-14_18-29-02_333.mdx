[An interactive guide to TanStack DB](https://reactdigest.net/links/20243/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)

TanStack DB is a new reactive client store that extends TanStack Query with three main features: Collections for storing typed data sets, Live Queries for fast filtering and joining data, and Transactional Mutations for optimistic updates. It solves common problems like managing relationships between data models and handling optimistic updates with less boilerplate code. The library can work with traditional REST APIs or sync engines for real-time data synchronization.

Meticulous automatically creates and maintains an exhaustive e2e UI test suite that covers every corner of your application – with no developer intervention required whatsoever. Dropbox, Lattice, Bilt Rewards and hundreds of organisations rely on Meticulous for their frontend testing. It is built from the Chromium level up with a deterministic scheduling engine – making it the only testing tool that eliminates flakes.

Shopify successfully migrated their largest mobile apps to React Native's New Architecture while maintaining weekly releases. They focused on minimal code changes first, supported both old and new architectures during development, and ensured performance stayed stable. The migration improved Android launch times by 10% and iOS by 3%.

[React fast refresh: Next-gen hot reloading explained](https://reactdigest.net/links/20246/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_9 minutes_ by James Reed

Fast Refresh is React's official hot reloading solution that updates code while keeping app state intact. Unlike live reloading which refreshes the entire browser, Fast Refresh only updates the changed components. It uses a Babel plugin to track components and hooks, then integrates with React's core to swap out old code for new versions. This lets developers see changes instantly without losing their current app state.

Next.js apps are naturally SEO-friendly, but you can boost their search performance further. Key strategies include setting up proper metadata in your layout files, using structured data markup for rich snippets, and generating sitemaps automatically. Also focus on image optimization and Core Web Vitals to improve loading speed and user experience.

[Building React apps with Bun](https://reactdigest.net/links/20248/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_9 minutes_ by Peter Mbanugo

Bun is a new JavaScript runtime that combines bundling, testing, and package management into one fast tool. It lets React developers create projects with a single command instead of juggling multiple tools like webpack or Vite. The tutorial shows how to build a blog app using Bun with React and Tailwind CSS, highlighting incredibly fast startup times and simplified configuration.
