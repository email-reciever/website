[The history of React through code](https://reactdigest.net/links/19770/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_36 minutes_ by Corbin Crutchley

Corbin explains how React's fundamental architecture decisions have enabled its growth from a simple UI library to a comprehensive framework. Key insights include how React's Virtual DOM enabled efficient rendering, how component composition principles have guided both UI elements and logic sharing, and how React's server components represent a natural evolution of its core philosophy.

_21 minutes_ by Kittisak Ma

PDF files are everywhere but working with PDFs in a React.js project can be frustrating. You might run into clunky plugins, awkward iframes, or glitches that break the user experience. PDF.js gives you a powerful, open-source JavaScript library to display and interact with PDF files right in the browser.

_14 minutes_ by Dominik Fojcik

Dominik explains how to create kinetic motion designs with text and images using Canvas2D and React Three Fiber. He shows a technique for building a stacked cylinder animation that displays images in a rotating format.

_13 minutes_ by Val Booth

Patreon's frontend team completely overhauled their internationalization system in 2024, migrating 10,000 JavaScript call sites, switching translation vendors, and redesigning their workflow. The project reduced build times by a full minute, decreased bundle sizes by up to 50%, and simplified maintenance.

[How to test React Server Component](https://reactdigest.net/links/19775/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_2 minutes_ by Nico Prananta

Nico presents a hacky but functional method for testing React Server Components, addressing a gap not yet filled by the Next.js or React teams. He shares a code snippet from Steven Robert's gist that allows developers to render and test server components by evaluating async functions and processing their children.

[How React engineers at Nubank and Ramp focus on UX (vs migrating class components and writing tests)](https://reactdigest.net/links/19776/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)

What do elite React teams at Ramp and Nubank have in common? They all save 10k+ hours monthly by delegating tedious work (think class migrations, test writing, prop drilling fixes) to Devin so they can focus on user experience and new features. Devin is a SWE agent built for real-world work. It analyzes your codebase to craft context-grounded plans before implementing and testing. Starting at $20.
