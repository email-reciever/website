[A deep dive into module federation with React](https://reactdigest.net/links/19798/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_32 minutes_ by Sudhir Mangla

Sudhir explores how micro-frontends and Module Federation can address scaling challenges in large enterprise web applications. He details implementation strategies for both React and Angular frameworks, including shell/remote component structure, shared dependencies, communication patterns, and routing coordination.

Starting with tools like Next.js or React for simple tasks often leads to bloated applications. Astro with Web Components delivers the same functionality while shipping 93% less JavaScript than Next.js and 79% less than SvelteKit. Loren argues that by analyzing constraints before choosing tools, developers can create more efficient solutions that prioritize user experience over developer comfort.

React’s concurrency APIs like useTransition are powerful tools for managing update prioritization. In Sierpinski triangle demo, they successfully deferred heavy ticking updates to keep interactions smooth — but they couldn’t protect animation performance when used inside React’s render cycle.

_7 minutes_ by Chris Krogh

Faire completed a major transition from class components and MobX to functional components and hooks in their largest React application, enhancing code maintainability and site performance despite starting the migration years after hooks were introduced. Chris shares the journey and how they accomplished it without disrupting product development.

[Introducing DataQueue](https://reactdigest.net/links/19803/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_2 minutes_ by Nico Prananta

DataQueue is an open-source library that uses PostgreSQL as storage for background job processing in Node.js applications. DataQueue offers type-safe support with TypeScript, allowing developers to define job types with specific payload requirements, ensuring data integrity throughout the job lifecycle. The library includes features like job tagging, retries, and delays, and can be used in serverless environments with cron jobs for processing.
