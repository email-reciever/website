[Your React Meta-Framework feels broken, here's why](https://reactdigest.net/links/19465/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_5 minutes_ by Peter Pistorius

Peter critiques modern web frameworks for overcomplicating development with unnecessary abstractions and conventions that fight against JavaScript's natural mental model. He argues that frameworks like Next.js and React Router introduce "magic" behavior that requires special knowledge, making code harder to understand.

[How to consume APIs in React using Fetch and Async/Await](https://reactdigest.net/links/19467/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_14 minutes_ by Lucas Geron

In this guide Lucas provides a comprehensive tutorial on consuming APIs in React applications, covering the Fetch API, asynchronous code with async/await, and proper integration into React components. He explains how to handle common challenges including request concurrency, loading states, and error handling, while offering practical code examples that demonstrate best practices for creating dynamic web applications.

[Progressive JSON](https://reactdigest.net/links/19468/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_12 minutes_ by Dan Abramov

Progressive JSON is a new approach to data transfer that allows clients to incrementally consume and render JSON as it streams in. Dan outlines a method where placeholders are used for parts of the JSON that haven't loaded yet, which are progressively filled in as data becomes available. This technique powers React Server Components, which can stream UI trees while letting developers control loading states with Suspense boundaries, decoupling data arrival from visual presentation.

[A visual exploration of core React concepts](https://reactdigest.net/links/19469/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_18 minutes_ by react.gg

This article provides a visual and historical journey through the evolution of front-end web development leading to React, highlighting key limitations of previous frameworks like jQuery, Backbone, and AngularJS. It explains React’s core innovations—component-based architecture, one-way data flow, and rendering views as functions of state. It also dives into essential concepts such as props, state management, effects, refs, context, concurrent rendering, and server components, offering clear visual metaphors and practical examples.

[Wake up, Remix!](https://reactdigest.net/links/19470/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_5 minutes_ by Michael Jackson, Ryan Florence

Michael and Ryan share the evolution of Remix and its convergence with React Router v7, which now includes many of Remix’s core features making it a stable, full-featured platform. With this solid foundation in place, the Remix team is reimagining the framework for v3: a modular, dependency-light, performance-first toolkit grounded in web standards and designed for both human and AI workflows.
