[React re-renders](https://reactdigest.net/links/19654/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)

Understanding re-renders in React is crucial for performance. You need to understand what triggers them. Know how they move through the app. Learn what happens during a re-render and why it matters.

[React Zero‑UI](https://reactdigest.net/links/19655/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_less than a minute_ by Austin Serb

Reactive state without re-rendering. Every setState in React triggers the full VDOM → Diff → Reconciliation → Paint pipeline. For pure UI state themes, menus, toggles that work is wasted. Using Zero-UI you can get 5-10× faster visual updates with no additional bundle cost

[Connect any React application to an MCP server](https://reactdigest.net/links/19656/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)

Cloudflare has open-sourced two tools for building Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients: use-mcp, a React library that simplifies connecting to remote MCP servers in just three lines of code, and AI Playground, a customizable chat interface for interacting with various LLMs. The use-mcp library handles connection management, authentication, dynamic tool discovery, and debugging capabilities, while maintaining compatibility with evolving MCP standards.

[Prefer gaps to margins](https://reactdigest.net/links/19657/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_5 minutes_ by Kyle Shevlin

Margins are applied to an element, either thru CSS or composition, and create a boundary around it such that the element itself can get no closer to any other element than the boundary. Gaps, on the other hand, are a way for a Flex or Grid container to space out the children it contains. Each gap is applied between adjacent sibling elements.

[React Server Components in Expo](https://reactdigest.net/links/19658/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_20 minutes_ by Jeferson Brito

The article explains how React Server Components work within Expo, introducing a new approach where certain components run on the server rather than the client. RSCs provide direct access to server-only resources like databases and file systems, with the rendered results streamed to the client.
