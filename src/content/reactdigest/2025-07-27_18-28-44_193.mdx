[Introducing Zustand](https://reactdigest.net/links/19843/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_9 minutes_ by Adam Rackis

Zustand is a minimal, but fun and effective state management library in React. It offers a simple yet effective approach that can improve performance over traditional React context. Adam demonstrates a toy task management app implemented in three ways: with React context, basic Zustand, and optimized Zustand. The key advantage of Zustand is its ability to minimize re-renders through selective state access, allowing components to subscribe only to the specific state they need rather than triggering full re-renders when any part of the state changes.

Meticulous automatically creates and maintains an exhaustive e2e UI test suite that covers every corner of your application – with no developer intervention required whatsoever. Dropbox, Lattice, Bilt Rewards and hundreds of organisations rely on Meticulous for their frontend testing. It is built from the Chromium level up with a deterministic scheduling engine – making it the only testing tool that eliminates flakes.

Recently we have seen a lot of discussions about server rendering in the React ecosystem, especially related to server components and Next.js. But, what about the future of classic SPAs?

[A guide to React graph visualization](https://reactdigest.net/links/19847/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_8 minutes_ by Courtney Collins

If you’re looking for a graph visualization toolkit, the first question that may come to mind is whether that toolkit fits with your existing technology stack. React graph visualization libraries have become the go-to choice for developers looking for powerful data visualization with hassle-free integration.

[How to use Action Routes in React Router](https://reactdigest.net/links/19848/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_4 minutes_ by Sergio Xalambrí

The Action Routes pattern in React Router centralizes action logic for creating, updating, or deleting resources in dedicated files under a routes/actions folder. Sergio describes this approach which enables reusing actions across different components while consolidating authentication, validation, responses, and client-side effects like toasts or redirects. The pattern follows a noun-verb naming convention and can include both server and client actions, with support for i18n and permissions handling, ultimately improving maintainability as applications grow.
