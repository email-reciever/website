[OpenAuth with React Router](https://reactdigest.net/links/19275/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_20 minutes_ by Sean Campbell

A comprehensive guide to implementing OpenAuth authentication in React Router applications using SST. Sean covers setting up an authentication server, configuring providers, implementing authentication flows, managing sessions, and creating protected routes.

[Getting started with Clerk Billing](https://reactdigest.net/links/19276/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_sponsored by Clerk_

Clerk recently released a new Billing product to enable SaaS subscription capabilities for B2B and B2C apps. In this video, Braden Sidoti (Clerk's co-founder and CTO) gives an overview of the product and walks through how to build a complete billing experience.

[How to build a React Login Page Template](https://reactdigest.net/links/19277/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_sponsored by Clerk_

This hands-on guide walks you through building a simple auth system with Express and React, covering both session- and JWT-based approaches. You’ll explore best practices, implement session authentication step by step, and walk away with a ready-to-use React login page template. Ideal for devs looking to secure their frontend apps with real-world patterns.

[How to build a custom renderer?](https://reactdigest.net/links/19278/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_8 minutes_ by Wojciech Kozyra

Wojciech explains how to integrate custom APIs with React by implementing a new React renderer. It outlines two integration approaches: implementing a new React renderer or implementing a new target platform for React Native.

[Dependency inversion: Building truly testable components](https://reactdigest.net/links/19279/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_3 minutes_ by Christian Ekrem

Christian discusses applying the Dependency Inversion Principle in React to reduce tight coupling. He shows how to refactor components to depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations, using a UserRepository interface as an example. This approach makes components more testable, maintainable, and flexible by separating high-level modules from low-level implementation details.

[React context is not causing too many renders](https://reactdigest.net/links/19280/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_3 minutes_ by David Johnston

David debunks the misconception that React context is inefficient for state management and demonstrates that context providers don't cause unnecessary re-renders of all child components. He explains that issues arise only when unrelated state is bundled into a single provider, but using multiple context providers solves this problem.

[Static as a Server](https://reactdigest.net/links/19281/d0444622-e98b-430a-9e1d-e3d73625b90d/email)  
_3 minutes_ by Dan Abramov

In this post Dan explains that React Server Components can be used for static websites without requiring a server runtim. He clarifies that modern "hybrid" frameworks like Next.js can run server components during the build process and generate static output, which eliminates the traditional distinction between "server" and "static" frameworks.
