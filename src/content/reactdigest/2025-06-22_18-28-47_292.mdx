Gesture detection is quickly going mainstream, making remote conversations feel more natural and engaging. Let’s explore how to detect hand gestures in JavaScript running in the browser and build a simple videoconferencing app with special effects.

Data fetching with useEffect is easy to use and great for quick one-off or practice apps. Corina used it for a long time - but recently, she's come to the conclusion it's best to just use react-query, even for the simplest cases. Why? Because to use it well it takes so much boilerplate, it's not really worth.

If you've developed a project with React, you've probably used the useState hook million times. When we use it, it's very simple. It's just a function which returns a state and a function that allows us to change that state. But on the inside, is it really that simple? Believe it or not, yes, it is! In this blog, we will create our own simplified useState function step by step.

If you've used local-first libraries before, you'll know the pitch. The idea is that the data your app needs is synced to the browser or device and stored locally, so that all reads and writes happen locally, with changes syncing to the server when possible. This gives an offline-capable experience, where the app always feels fast and responsive. But there is a catch. Many of these libraries want to sync everything.
