[React concurrent features: An overview](https://certificates.dev/blog/react-concurrent-features-an-overview)  
_8 minutes_ by Aurora Scharff

Learn React's key concurrent features—useTransition, useDeferredValue, Suspense, and useOptimistic—and how they coordinate to create smooth, responsive user experiences. Includes practical examples and best practices.

Meticulous automatically creates and maintains an exhaustive e2e UI test suite that covers every corner of your application – with no developer intervention required whatsoever. Dropbox, Lattice, Bilt Rewards and hundreds of organisations rely on Meticulous for their frontend testing. It is built from the Chromium level up with a deterministic scheduling engine – making it the only testing tool that eliminates flakes.

_7 minutes_ by Ryan Skinner

Rari renders components 4 times faster, handles 3.74 times more requests per second, and builds projects 5.8 times quicker. It combines Rust's speed with JavaScript's ecosystem while maintaining full React Server Component compatibility and familiar developer experience.

[React’s useTransition and state update reordering](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/react-rebasing/)  
_2 minutes_ by Jordan Eldredge

React applies state updates in chronological order, but with a twist when using transitions. If a synchronous update interrupts a transition, React temporarily shows a value that skips the transition update.

_8 minutes_ by David Höck

A comprehensive guide to self-hosting Next.js in production with horizontal scaling, covering critical solutions for distributed caching, image optimization, reverse proxy configuration, and deployment challenges learned from real-world experience.

[Cancel action or modify payload before useActionState](https://www.nico.fyi/blog/new-feature-for-use-resettable-action-state)  
_2 minutes_ by Nico Prananta

A React hook called useResettableActionState now includes a beforeAction feature that lets developers cancel form submissions or modify data before sending it to the server. This is useful for validating inputs like password confirmation or adding security tokens like Google reCAPTCHA right before submission. The hook eliminates the need for additional state management code.
