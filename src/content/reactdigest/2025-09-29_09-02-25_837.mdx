Hi üëã,

Thank you for subscribing! My name is Jakub and I'm a CTO, founder, and a coder. I‚Äôve been in tech for a couple of decades now. And slowly progressed to senior engineer, tech lead and all the way up to senior leadership while staying technical.

Every week I'll share the most interesting articles that will help you become a better software engineer.

But now, I‚Äôd love to learn something about you. Would you mind taking **30 seconds to reply** to this email and tell me:

1.  who you are,
2.  what you are working on,
3.  what your biggest challenge is right now.

It will help me understand better which content to share every week. And sometimes I might even have some suggestions and resources that you can start using right now.

Cheers,  
Jakub

P.S. A little bit of housekeeping ... if you'd like to make sure that you won't miss an issue:

1.  Move this email to your [primary inbox](https://www.wisestamp.com/blog/how-to-move-email-from-promotions-to-primary-in-gmail/).
2.  And add me to your contacts.
