[Unlocking web workers with React](https://www.rahuljuliato.com/posts/react-workers)  
_7 minutes_ by Rahul M. Juliato

In this guide, we'll explore how Web Workers can help us keep our React interfaces responsive, even when dealing with heavy computational tasks. We'll go through a practical example, starting with a common problem and evolving to more robust solutions.

_sponsored by Meticulous_

Meticulous automatically creates and maintains an exhaustive e2e UI test suite that covers every corner of your application – with no developer intervention required whatsoever. Dropbox, Lattice, Bilt Rewards and hundreds of organisations rely on Meticulous for their frontend testing. It is built from the Chromium level up with a deterministic scheduling engine – making it the only testing tool that eliminates flakes.

_4 minutes_ by Rafał Krupiński

Stan is another state management library for TypeScript that implements the atomic approach. Its core promise is minimal, type-safe state management. Positioned between Jotai and Recoil, Stan aims for the middle ground while avoiding bloat and framework lock-in through a framework-agnostic core with optional bindings.

Select. One of Dominik's favourite features in React Query that you'll hopefully never need. But if you need, it can be a life-saver.

[Building testable telegram bots with Zustand](https://zwit.link/posts/zustand-telegram-bot/)  
_11 minutes_ by Giovanni Crisalfi

When most developers think of Zustand, they picture React hooks and component state. But what if I told you that Zustand's vanilla store could power a sophisticated Telegram bot with predictable state management and reactive behavior?
