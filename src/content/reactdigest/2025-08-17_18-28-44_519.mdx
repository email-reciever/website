[React Cache: It's about consistency](https://twofoldframework.com/blog/react-cache-its-about-consistency)  
_9 minutes_ by Ryan Toronto

In this post, Ryan wants to make the case for appreciating cache as more than just a memoization and optimization technique for network data fetching, but instead as an API that guarantees consistency across an entire RSC render.

Meticulous automatically creates and maintains an exhaustive e2e UI test suite that covers every corner of your application – with no developer intervention required whatsoever. Dropbox, Lattice, Bilt Rewards and hundreds of organisations rely on Meticulous for their frontend testing. It is built from the Chromium level up with a deterministic scheduling engine – making it the only testing tool that eliminates flakes.

[Let's not optimize your optimization](https://dev.to/abhishekkrpand1/lets-not-optimize-your-optimization-2he6)  
_5 minutes_ by Abhishek Pandey

New developers often hear or read that useCallback and useMemo are tools to improve the performance of a React application. As a result, they start using them everywhere, hoping to optimize their app. But this usually leads to cluttered, overly verbose code, filled with complex dependency arrays—and ironically, it often hurts more than it helps.

[Building React Multi-Tab Sync](https://dev.to/idanshalem/building-react-multi-tab-sync-a-custom-hook-with-the-broadcastchannel-api-c6d)  
_6 minutes_ by Idan Shalem

Ever opened two tabs of your React app and watched them slowly drift out of sync? Maybe a logout in one tab doesn’t register in the other. Or a filter change in one view disappears in the second. It's not a bug in your code – it's a blind spot in how most apps handle state.

[React Native 0.81 released](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/08/12/react-native-0.81)  
_7 minutes_ by Moti Zilberman

This new release ships with support for Android 16 (API level 36) and includes a variety of other stability improvements and bugfixes, as well as experimental support for faster iOS builds using precompilation.

[How to avoid waterfalls in React Suspense](https://sergiodxa.com/tutorials/avoid-waterfalls-in-react-suspense)  
_2 minutes_ by Sergio Xalambrí

React’s Suspense is great for orchestrating asynchronous UI rendering, but it’s easy to accidentally introduce a “waterfall”, where one piece of async work waits unnecessarily for another to finish before starting. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how sibling and nested Suspense boundaries behave, how this relates to JavaScript’s async patterns, and how to structure your data fetching to avoid delays.
