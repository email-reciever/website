# Full-Stack Tao Releases on February 12th

  
I still can’t believe it. The book I’ve been working on for years will finally see the light of day. In a few weeks, you will be able to get it digitally on Gumroad and on paperback from Amazon. Thank you all for the patience and I hope that the book will live up to your expectations. You can learn more on the [website](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca&id=5ffc6c9104&e=6955ce1080).  
  
Here's some more info if you're not in the loop.  
 

## What’s "Full-Stack Tao"?

It’s a collection of everything I’ve learned about programming during the last decade in the industry. It starts from code-level principles, things as simple as how to name your variables, then builds up to design patterns and continues to high-level ideas about picking a tech stack. It’s the things I wish someone had told me earlier.

## What's it about?

In its essence, Full-Stack Tao is a book about software design, similar to “Clean Code” and “A philosophy of software design”. But the problem I’ve always had with such books is that they favor certain code qualities without explaining why. In this book, I focus on maintainability and all ideas stem from that.

We need to be able to build applications that we can maintain, extend, and modify over a long period of time. Building something is easy - you’ll scratch and you’ll claw and you’ll put software in production that gets the job done. But taking care of that application, supporting it as it grows and changes - that’s a real challenge, one we don’t study enough about.

## Principles > Dogma

I try to destroy the myth that you need rigid structure and design patterns in all cases. Depending on how long your application will live in production and who will own it you might be able to get away with something much simpler. Engineering complexity is a spectrum and it depends on the context in which you’re building software.

_I can’t wait to tell you all about it on February 12th!_

# 全栈 tao 于 2 月 12 日发布

我仍然不敢相信。我多年来一直在写的书终于要面世了。几周后，您将能够在 Gumroad 上获得该书的数字版以及从亚马逊获得平装本。感谢大家的耐心等待，希望这本书不负大家的期望。您可以在[网站](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca\&id=5ffc6c9104\&e=6955ce1080)上了解更多信息。

如果您不了解情况，这里有更多信息。\
 

\##什么是“全栈道”？

它汇集了我过去十年在该行业学到的有关编程的所有知识。它从代码级原则开始，比如如何命名变量等简单的事情，然后构建设计模式，并继续到有关选择技术堆栈的高级想法。我希望有人早点告诉我这些事情。

## 这是关于什么的？

从本质上讲，《全栈道》是一本关于软件设计的书，类似于《干净代码》和《软件设计哲学》。但我对此类书籍一直存在的问题是，它们偏爱某些代码质量，却没有解释原因。在本书中，我关注可维护性，所有想法都源于此。

我们需要能够构建可以长期维护、扩展和修改的应用程序。构建一些东西很容易——你会摸索、抓抓，然后将软件投入生产来完成工作。但是，照顾好这个应用程序，在它的成长和变化时支持它——这是一个真正的挑战，我们对此研究得还不够。

## 原则 > 教条

我试图打破“在所有情况下都需要严格的结构和设计模式”的神话。根据您的应用程序在生产环境中的生存时间以及谁将拥有它，您可能会得到更简单的东西。工程复杂性是一个范围，它取决于您构建软件的环境。

*我迫不及待地想在 2 月 12 日告诉大家这一切！*
