# Full-Stack Tao is Finally Out!

A collection of my write-ups and ideas in the last 10 years. It holds everything I’ve learned about software design with practical examples with JavaScript and React. It's out on [Gumroad](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca&id=c0e19a4907&e=6955ce1080) for digital & [Amazon](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca&id=1763317758&e=6955ce1080) for paperbacks.  
 

## Who is it for?

Intermediate engineers who want to make the leap to the senior level will take the most out of this book.

If you’re a beginner you might find it a bit challenging but it will still be rewarding.

If you’re an expert, I doubt I’ll be able to teach you something new, but you might enjoy my writing either way.  
 

## What’s the book about?

It’s a collection of good practices focused on software maintainability above everything else.  
I believe good taste in code quality will become even more important in the age of LLMs as we turn into editors rather than writers. That's why I've been so focused on this topic.  
 

## What technologies does it cover?

This isn’t a book that will teach you React. It uses popular tools (react-query, tRPC, TypeScript) to explain key concepts, but the principles in it are applicable across all programming languages and tech stacks.

The goal is to teach you timeless software design principles that you can apply in your career, regardless of the specific tools you’re using.  
 

## What are the contents?

Chapter 1 - The importance of principles.

Chapter 2 - Code-level best practices, loops, conditionals, variables, and functions.

Chapter 3 - The SOLID principles in practical examples.

Chapter 4 - Practical clean architecture, modules, forms, and state management.

Chapter 5 - Designing a lambda, a script, ORMs, DB complexity, testing.

Chapter 6 - Setting up the project, picking a tech stack, how to build features.  
 

## Not sure if it's for you?

A few of the chapters from the book are free to read on my blog and you can go through them before you decide if you want to read the rest. Go to the [book website](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca&id=6815afc812&e=6955ce1080) and scroll to the table of contents. They're all linked there!
