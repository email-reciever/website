# I started a YouTube channel

  
Earlier this year I decided to explore other mediums for my content and started a YouTube channel. I don't do tutorials or guides, I talk about the corners of the industry that people don't pay enough attention to, the ideas that are not hyped enough.  
  
Right now I'm recording a series of videos about software design - perhaps the most important skill an engineer needs to have in the future.  
  
Today I wanted to share with you the last two videos I've recorded in case you prefer watching over reading:  
  
[Everything about abstractions in 23 minutes](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca&id=c172155a75&e=6955ce1080) - This is the latest video in the series all focused on what it takes to create good abstractions. Reusable functions, classes, modules, and services - they are meant to hide complexity, help us deal with duplication and serve as adapters to 3rd party components. But even though software correctness is an exercise in logic, software design is about intuition, trial, and error.  
  
[Everything about software complexity in 20 minutes](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca&id=90374f3eb1&e=6955ce1080) - This is the first video from the series and I chose complexity for it because it's the underlying problem behind everything else in our craft. Complex software is hard to maintain and extend, limiting business growth and slowing down development. I talk about different strategies to deal with complexity.  
  
If you've been following me for a while, the ideas in this video won't be anything new. I've based them on the research and content I've been working on for the last few years. If you're not into video content and prefer the written word, here are the articles that these videos are based on:  
  
[Leaky Abstractions](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca&id=bc3521281e&e=6955ce1080) - how abstractions that force us to think about their internal details are increasing the complexity of our apps  
  
[Wrong Abstractions](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca&id=e525fb2997&e=6955ce1080) - how rushing to create reusable functions can cause more harm than good  
  
[Art, Details, and Abstractions](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca&id=25121a4355&e=6955ce1080) - what's an abstraction anyway  
  
[What is complexity?](https://alexkondov.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fca75767fa83fa3473478b4ca&id=5b8cca9e6b&e=6955ce1080) - why do we care so much about complexity and why this is our biggest problem  
  
Maybe start from the bottom up.  
  
Hope you like the videos! If not, I will continue sending software design insights to your inbox in a few weeks.
