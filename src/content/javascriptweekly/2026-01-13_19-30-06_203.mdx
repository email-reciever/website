[Date is _Out_, Temporal is _In_](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/179125/d076523b1d "piccalil.li") — The [Temporal API](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/179126/d076523b1d) has been promised as a future API tackling the weaknesses of JavaScript’s `Date` [for many years](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/179127/d076523b1d) now, but finally that future is arriving. Mat leans on numerous examples to show off `Date`'s weaknesses and push Temporal’s strengths here.

💡 Temporal's [browser support](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/179128/d076523b1d) still looks weak, but [Chrome 144](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/179129/d076523b1d) – rolling out generally this week – brings full support. [Temporal Polyfill](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/179130/d076523b1d) also offers a stop-gap while native support grows.

[How Wrong Can a JavaScript Date Calculation Go?](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/179131/d076523b1d "philna.sh") — _“the story of an issue that I faced that will be much easier to handle once_ `Temporal` _is more widespread.”_
