Four Heavyweights Drop Updates

Four stalwarts of the JavaScript ecosystem all shipped notable releases this week, and odds are you're using at least one of them:

*   [Gatsby v5.16](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/180162/d076523b1d) proves Gatsby, once considered neck-and-neck with Next.js in the React world, is [_not_ 'dead'.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/180163/d076523b1d) The headline feature is React 19 support.
    
*   [Babel 7 just shipped its final release.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/180164/d076523b1d) _"After years in the making, Babel 8 is finally ready,"_ in [release candidate form](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/180166/d076523b1d), at least.
    
*   [Rspress 2.0](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/180167/d076523b1d) is a major release for the high-performance Rust-powered, but JavaScript-facing, static site generator.
    
*   [Lodash 4.17.23](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/180168/d076523b1d) sounds minor, but it's a 'security reset' for the still heavily used [utility library](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/180169/d076523b1d) and is designed to provide a base for a longer future.
