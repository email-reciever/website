Here's a selection of things from the broader ecosystem we've noticed this week:

*   The CSS Overflow 5 spec enables the creation of [pure CSS scroll and 'carousel' experiences](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169152/d076523b1d) on the Web, and Sara Soueidan has dug in deep and done [an accessibility and usability analysis of the feature.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169153/d076523b1d) Is it time to give up your JavaScript-based approach?

*   One team decided to move away from Next.js and migrate to Ruby on Rails, while still maintaining a React frontend – [here's their tale of why and how.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169156/d076523b1d)
    
*   [Postgres 18 Beta 1](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169157/d076523b1d) was released. IO performance on Linux is a big focus. The final release is due in September or October.
    
*   🤖 [Google has updated its Gemini 2.5 Pro model](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169158/d076523b1d) – they claim it's now far better at building frontend apps in particular with 'a real taste for aesthetic web development'.

Here's a selection of things from the broader ecosystem we've noticed this week:

* The CSS Overflow 5 spec enables the creation of [pure CSS scroll and 'carousel' experiences](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169152/d076523b1d) on the Web, and Sara Soueidan has dug in deep and done [an accessibility and usability analysis of the feature.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169153/d076523b1d) Is it time to give up your JavaScript-based approach? Not yet, says Sara.

* Sam Rose is back with another fantastic visual essay - [this time looking at 'reservoir sampling.'](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169154/d076523b1d) As well as getting to learn a useful programming technique in a visual way, you can also check out [all the JavaScript code he built](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169155/d076523b1d) that powers the article.

* One team decided to move away from Next.js and migrate to Ruby on Rails, while still maintaining a React frontend – [here's their tale of why and how.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169156/d076523b1d)

* [Postgres 18 Beta 1](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169157/d076523b1d) was released. IO performance on Linux is a big focus. The final release is due in September or October.

* 🤖 [Google has updated its Gemini 2.5 Pro model](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169158/d076523b1d) – they claim it's now far better at building frontend apps in particular with 'a real taste for aesthetic web development'.

P.S. If you're into React or Node.js, we focus more directly on those in [React Status](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169159/d076523b1d) and [Node Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169160/d076523b1d) respectively, so check out the latest issues of those too :-)
