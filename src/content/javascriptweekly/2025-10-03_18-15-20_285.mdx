Velato was built by [Daniel Temkin](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175239/d076523b1d), the author of [_Forty-Four Esolangs_](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175238/d076523b1d), a new book, published by MIT Press, about an artist's take on creating esoteric programming languages.

Have you ever wanted to program by *whistling?* Now you can. [Velato](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175237/d076523b1d) is a JavaScript-inspired esoteric language designed to be written entirely by whistling and you can give it a go in your browser right now. I struggled with it, but you might have more luck (it doesn't seem to like Safari, for starters).

Velato was built by [Daniel Temkin](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175239/d076523b1d), the author of [*Forty-Four Esolangs*](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175238/d076523b1d), a new book, published by MIT Press, about an artist's take on creating esoteric programming languages.
