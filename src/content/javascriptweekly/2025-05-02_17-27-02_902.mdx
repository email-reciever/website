A quick roundup of other interesting updates and useful resources from across the broader developer landscape:

*   **Redis is open source again!** The popular [Redis](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168796/d076523b1d) in-memory data store ran into [a bit of drama in recent years with a license change](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168797/d076523b1d) following its acquisition. The good news is that [an AGPL license is now an option](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168798/d076523b1d) for the new [Redis 8 release](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168799/d076523b1d) making Redis truly _'open source again.'_
    
*   **TypeScript ←→ C#:** I've been dabbling with a little C# recently (it's the main language used in Unity game development) and enjoyed this [_TypeScript is Like C#_ guide](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168800/d076523b1d) oriented largely around showing TypeScript/JavaScript vs C# examples of doing the same things.
    
*   **❤️ JS + HTML:** It's a simple thing, but [Simon Willison reminds us](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168801/d076523b1d) that static HTML enriched with JavaScript and served up on GitHub Pages is one of the best ways you can give software freely for the world to use.
    
*   **Emulators-a-plenty:** [Tiny Emus](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168802/d076523b1d) is a showcase of almost 200 emulators that run in the browser, largely for 8 bit platforms, games, and even some visual CPU demos.
    
*   **CSS shapes:** Did you know [CSS now has a `shape()` function](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168803/d076523b1d) for drawing complex shapes for clipping paths?

A quick roundup of other interesting updates and useful resources from across the broader developer landscape:

* **Redis is open source again!** The popular [Redis](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168796/d076523b1d) in-memory data store ran into [a bit of drama in recent years with a license change](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168797/d076523b1d) following its acquisition. The good news is that [an AGPL license is now an option](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168798/d076523b1d) for the new [Redis 8 release](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168799/d076523b1d) making Redis truly *'open source again.'*

* **TypeScript ←→ C#:** I've been dabbling with a little C# recently (it's the main language used in Unity game development) and enjoyed this [*TypeScript is Like C#* guide](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168800/d076523b1d) oriented largely around showing TypeScript/JavaScript vs C# examples of doing the same things.

* **❤️ JS + HTML:** It's a simple thing, but [Simon Willison reminds us](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168801/d076523b1d) that static HTML enriched with JavaScript and served up on GitHub Pages is one of the best ways you can give software freely for the world to use.

* **Emulators-a-plenty:** [Tiny Emus](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168802/d076523b1d) is a showcase of almost 200 emulators that run in the browser, largely for 8 bit platforms, games, and even some visual CPU demos.

* **CSS shapes:** Did you know [CSS now has a `shape()` function](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168803/d076523b1d) for drawing complex shapes for clipping paths?
