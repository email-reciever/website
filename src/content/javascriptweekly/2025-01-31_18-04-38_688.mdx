[Announcing TypeScript 5.8 Beta](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165118/d076523b1d "devblogs.microsoft.com") — It’s that time again. What’s new? Support for using `require()` for ES modules in Node 22+, checked returns for conditional and indexed access types, startup and building optimizations & more. While not a huge release overall, it's particularly good for Node devs.

Daniel Rosenwasser

💡 One neat 5.8 feature is [`--erasableSyntaxOnly`](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165119/d076523b1d), a way to ensure that 'type stripping' techniques still result in runnable code by disallowing TypeScript-exclusive features like enums.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   🎬 Remember Honeypot's [well-received Node.js documentary](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165120/d076523b1d)? (If not, watch it!) Now there's [a trailer for an _Angular_ documentary](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165121/d076523b1d) due soon.
    
*   There's been a lot of chatter about _Create React App_ being effectively 'deprecated' due to a lack of updates from Meta. Turns out, [it _is_ deprecated](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165122/d076523b1d), but [the process is now being managed gracefully](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165123/d076523b1d) and some basic React 19 support will be merged in.
    
*   A developer came up with [an approach to making npm packages 5% smaller](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165124/d076523b1d) using Zopfli compression and asked the npm team to consider it. Ultimately the decision was no for [a variety of reasons.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165125/d076523b1d)
    
*   ⭐ The _Syntax_ YouTube channel presents [▶️ a fun countdown of the top 15 most starred JavaScript projects](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165165/d076523b1d) on GitHub. This is so well put together.
