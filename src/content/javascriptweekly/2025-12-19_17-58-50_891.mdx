[The JavaScript Bundler Grand Prix](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178698/d076523b1d "redmonk.com") — Bundlers now sit at the heart of many JavaScript workflows and are sometimes even integrated into runtimes (e.g. [Bun’s](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178699/d076523b1d)). This piece surveys the landscape and argues the speed wars are mostly over, with the real battle shifting to artifact size and the code that actually ships to users.
