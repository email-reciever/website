[The 2025 JavaScript Rising Stars](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178794/d076523b1d "risingstars.js.org") — At the start of each year, Michael rounds up the projects in the JavaScript ecosystem that gained the most popularity on GitHub in the prior year. After a two-year run of topping the chart, `shadcn/ui` has been pushed down to #3 by [n8n](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178795/d076523b1d) and [React Bits](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178796/d076523b1d). This is a fantastic roundup, now in its tenth(!) year, and features commentary from a few industry experts too.

[MicroQuickJS: A New JavaScript Engine from Fabrice Bellard](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178797/d076523b1d "github.com") — [Fabrice](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178798/d076523b1d), one of the world’s most prolific developers well-known for creating FFmpeg, QEMU and [QuickJS](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178799/d076523b1d), is back with a new JavaScript engine targeting embedded systems, and that can run with as little as 10KB of RAM.

💡 The [discussion about MicroQuickJS on Hacker News](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178800/d076523b1d) was particularly rich. Redis's creator, Salvatore Sanfilippo, even noted that Redis would have used JavaScript as its scripting language instead of Lua if this had existed in 2010.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [pnpm](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178855/d076523b1d)'s lead maintainer, Zoltan Kochan, presents [a look back at how 2025 was a transformative year for the project.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178801/d076523b1d)
    
*   If you missed [our final issue of 2025](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/766), be sure to check it out. We did a month-by-month rundown of what happened in the JavaScript world and shared the top ten links of the year.
    
*   [WebF](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178802/d076523b1d) is a new WHATWG-compliant web runtime for Flutter so you can build parts of Flutter apps using a more typical JS stack (React, Vue, etc.)
    

**RELEASES:**

*   [pnpm 10.27](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178803/d076523b1d) – The alternative, efficient (and increasingly security-focused) package manager gets some tweaks, including a setting to ignore trust policy checks for packages published more than a specified time ago.

*   🎨 [Color.js v0.6](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178806/d076523b1d) – The popular standards-compliant color conversion and manipulation library approaches its eventual 1.0 release.
    
*   [Prisma 7.2](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178807/d076523b1d), [Deno 2.6.4](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178808/d076523b1d)

[How to Compile JavaScript to C with Static Hermes](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178809/d076523b1d "devongovett.me") — The creator of [Parcel](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178810/d076523b1d) is porting parts of the project to Rust, but this raises some challenges on interoperating with existing JavaScript plugins, especially without a runtime JS interpreter. What about compiling JavaScript to C libraries that can be called directly? It’s possible!
