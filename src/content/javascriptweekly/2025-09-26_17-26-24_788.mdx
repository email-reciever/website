![](https://res.cloudinary.com/cpress/image/upload/w_240,e_sharpen:60,q_auto/lioslh725i8k02a34tyl.jpg)

Over the past couple of months the esteemed Dr. Axel Rauschmayer has been working on [a valuable series of beginner-friendly posts](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174895/d076523b1d) on a range of web development topics, with a heavy focus on JavaScript. He pitches the series as a way to teach people "_who have never programmed how to create web apps with JavaScript_".

These are all excellent primers/refreshers, and ideal for sharing with those early in their web development journey. Here are some of the highlights so far:

*   Working with [numbers, variables, and functions](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174896/d076523b1d), and [strings and methods.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174897/d076523b1d)

*   Digging into [plain objects](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174900/d076523b1d), [`Array`s](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174901/d076523b1d), [`Map`s](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174902/d076523b1d), and [exceptions.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174903/d076523b1d)
*   An [introduction to frontend frameworks](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174904/d076523b1d) using Preact.

Over the past couple of months the esteemed Dr. Axel Rauschmayer has been working on [a valuable series of beginner-friendly posts](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174895/d076523b1d) on a range of web development topics, with a heavy focus on JavaScript. He pitches the series as a way to teach people "*who have never programmed how to create web apps with JavaScript*".

These are all excellent primers/refreshers, and ideal for sharing with those early in their web development journey. Here are some of the highlights so far:

* Working with [numbers, variables, and functions](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174896/d076523b1d), and [strings and methods.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174897/d076523b1d)
* [Booleans, comparisons and `if` statements](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174898/d076523b1d) and [loops.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174899/d076523b1d)
* Digging into [plain objects](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174900/d076523b1d), [`Array`s](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174901/d076523b1d), [`Map`s](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174902/d076523b1d), and [exceptions.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174903/d076523b1d)
* An [introduction to frontend frameworks](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/174904/d076523b1d) using Preact.
