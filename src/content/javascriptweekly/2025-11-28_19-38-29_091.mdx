📢  Elsewhere in the ecosystem

Some other interesting tidbits in the broader landscape:

* If you've not yet played with CSS's "subgrid" feature (now [supported](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177793/d076523b1d) in all major browsers), Josh W Comeau has [a fantastic introduction to the new possibilities subgrids offer your layouts](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177794/d076523b1d).

* ⚠️ GitHub reports secrets/tokens leaked in Git repos to the service providers so they can be revoked, but now it's [reporting secrets in unlisted GitHub Gist posts too](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177795/d076523b1d) (so be careful when using it as a 'private' pastebin).

* [The RetroGameCoders IDE](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177796/d076523b1d) is a JavaScript and WebAssembly-powered online IDE/playground for coding against retro machines, now including the C64, Apple II, MSX, Atari 800, and others.

* 🤖 Addy Osmani has written [a neat roundup of what's new in Gemini 3.0](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177797/d076523b1d), the latest version of Google's leading LLMs. He touches on Nano Banana Pro image generation, Google's new *Antigravity* dev tool, and how the updates benefit developers. Not keen to be left behind, however, Anthropic [released Claude Opus 4.5](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177798/d076523b1d) earlier this week.

* [The team behind the Zig language isn't happy with GitHub](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177799/d076523b1d) and so is migrating from GitHub to Codeberg.
