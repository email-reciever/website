[JavaScript's New Superpower? Explicit Resource Management](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169427/d076523b1d "v8.dev") — V8 v13.8 introduces the idea of deterministic resource cleanup. Among a range of new symbols and objects for the task, the basic idea is you can wrap any file handle, stream or connection in a `using`/`await using` block and the runtime will handle any cleanup once resources go out of scope.

[Basecoat: `shadcn/ui`'s Magic, But Minus React](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169428/d076523b1d "basecoatui.com") — [shadcn/ui](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169429/d076523b1d) is a popular suite of well designed React components, but if you’d like to use them in _other_ contexts too, Basecoat is for you. Basecoat ports the components to a more vanilla form you can use with your framework (or not) of choice.
