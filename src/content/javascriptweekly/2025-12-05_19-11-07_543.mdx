🎉  JavaScript Turns 30 Years Old  🎉

Back in May 1995, a 33 year old Brendan Eich [built the first prototype of JavaScript in just ten days](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178085/d076523b1d), originally codenamed _Mocha_ (and then _LiveScript_). On December 4, 1995, Netscape and Sun Microsystems [officially announced 'JavaScript' in a press release](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178086/d076523b1d) as _"an easy-to-use object scripting language designed for creating live online applications that link together objects and resources on both clients and servers."_

Over thirty years, JavaScript has cemented its place at the heart of the Web platform, and more broadly in desktop apps, operating systems (e.g. Windows' use of React Native), mobile apps, and even [on microcontrollers.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178087/d076523b1d)

Here's to another thirty years and, hopefully, the [resolution of the confusion and litigation around JavaScript's trademark.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/178088/d076523b1d) C'mon, Larry, give us all a Xmas present we won't forget? 😅

_P.S. Enjoy finding the 1995 references in our special birthday montage above._
