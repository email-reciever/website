Snap

💡 [Valdi's FAQ](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177063/d076523b1d) answers several questions you might have, including how it works and why you might pick Valdi over React Native.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   The TC39 committee behind ECMAScript is meeting for the 111th time next week and [has a packed agenda to discuss.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177064/d076523b1d) _(Thanks to [Rob Palmer](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177065/d076523b1d) for the heads up.)_
    
*   For Stack Overflow, Tanya Janca shares [several tips for writing more secure JavaScript.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177066/d076523b1d)
    
*   The co-founder of the fantastic [Val Town](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177067/d076523b1d) online JavaScript platform shares [a retrospective of its past three years](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/177068/d076523b1d), as well as two roles they're hiring for.
