🏆 [TypeScript Leaps to #1 Most Used Language on GitHub](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/176432/d076523b1d "github.blog") — As part of this week’s [GitHub Universe](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/176433/d076523b1d) event, GitHub released its annual report of activity on the platform. A year ago, Python jumped to #1, pushing JavaScript to #3, but this year TypeScript takes the crown and GitHub suggests LLM-oriented development played a role. Taking JavaScript and TypeScript together, however, places our ecosystem far out in front.
