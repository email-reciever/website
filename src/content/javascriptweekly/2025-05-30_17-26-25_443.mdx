[_Wake Up, Remix!_ Everything's Changing..](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169919/d076523b1d "remix.run") — Big news from the [Remix](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169920/d076523b1d) camp this week. About a year ago, [Remix and React Router merged together](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169921/d076523b1d) reflecting their shared goals and code, but now it’s _all change_ again. [React Router](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169922/d076523b1d) is now basically what Remix originally intended to be, and so ‘Remix’ is rebooting as a model-first, low-dependency, Web API-centric full-stack framework built on [Preact](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169923/d076523b1d).

[Announcing Angular v20](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/169927/d076523b1d "blog.angular.dev") — A big release for the Google backed framework where a lot of the more recent experimental features (like signals and incremental hydration) have received a lot of polish and been promoted as stable. There are new experimental APIs too, including resource streaming and `httpResource` for making HTTP requests with a signal-based reactive API.
