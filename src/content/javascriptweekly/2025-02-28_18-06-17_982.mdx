[Read on the Web](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/725)

✏️ Whenever we include more than a few links about TypeScript, we get complaints from people who _don't like it._ We get that, we love you folks, and we're aware. TypeScript isn't our _main focus_ but we do cover it, including critical pieces. That in mind, prepare yourself for our top feature... but the rest of the issue is mostly JavaScript, promise! 😅

[Developer Implements 'Doom' in TypeScript's Type System](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/166288/d076523b1d "socket.dev") — A curious quirk of TypeScript’s type system is that [it is Turing-complete](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/166289/d076523b1d) which has led some developers to implement apps entirely _in_ the type system. One such developer has spent eighteen months producing 177 _terabytes_ of types to get 1993’s Doom running with them. Ridiculous and amazing in equal measure, he [▶️ explains the project in this widely lauded 7-minute video.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/166290/d076523b1d) 👏

[What _is_ TypeScript? An Overview for JavaScript Programmers](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/166293/d076523b1d "2ality.com") — You may have noticed esteemed JavaScript developer and author Dr. Axel has been on a TypeScript odyssey recently. Here he does a good job at boiling down the _what_ (rather than the ‘why’) of TypeScript. A handy primer on what’s going on, even if you don’t plan to use it, since you'll end up interacting with it _somewhere.._
