🥚 A Good Friday, if you celebrate Easter at all. We're taking a little break but didn't want to take the _entire_ week off, so we have a slimline issue for you today :-) We'll be back to full service next Friday!

[The ECMAScript Records and Tuples Proposal Has Been Withdrawn](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168197/d076523b1d "github.com") — Several years in the making, the [record and tuples proposal](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168198/d076523b1d) offered two new deeply immutable data structures to JavaScript, but at this week’s TC39 meeting, the consensus was to drop it.

There have, however, been some more positive updates:

*   [A proposal for introducing enums to JavaScript](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168199/d076523b1d) has advanced to stage 1. It seeks the adoption of a compatible form of TypeScript's `enum` declaration. [Slidedeck here.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168200/d076523b1d)
    
*   The [Deferred re-exports proposal](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168201/d076523b1d) has advanced to stage 2. There's [a slidedeck walking through the feature.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168202/d076523b1d)
    
*   The [Upsert](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168203/d076523b1d) and [Composites](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/168204/d076523b1d) proposals have been advanced.
