[When is WebAssembly Going to Get DOM Support?](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/172282/d076523b1d "queue.acm.org") — Working with the DOM from JavaScript is straightforward, but WebAssembly requires glue code to do it.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   Over on X, Feross Aboukhadijeh [explains a major supply chain breach in the JS ecosystem](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/172283/d076523b1d) where popular packages, including `is`, were hijacked to ship malware. [Here's an article on the specifics](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/172284/d076523b1d), if you'd prefer.
    
*   [npm took down the `stylus` package](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/172285/d076523b1d) for a while, due to security issues, which caused quite a few problems.. this is a rather extensive story.
