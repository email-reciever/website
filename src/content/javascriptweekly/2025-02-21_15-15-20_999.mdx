A quick roundup of some of other interesting updates or useful resources in the broader developer landscape:

* [The XOR operator, and logic gate, explained.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/166015/d076523b1d) (You can use XOR yourself in JavaScript with the `^` operator.)

* [Learn Shader Programming with Rick and Morty](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/166016/d076523b1d) is a fun and accessible way to learn a bit about shaders and GLSL and, in particular, rendering *shapes* with shaders.

* Beej, author of [several popular guides](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/166017/d076523b1d) to different programming concepts, has [released *Beej's Guide to Git*](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/166018/d076523b1d), a great zero-to-expert online resource for using the world's most popular DVCS.

* Most of them don't apply to JavaScript, but I found [this walkthrough of NASA's "10 rules for software development"](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/166019/d076523b1d) quite interesting.
