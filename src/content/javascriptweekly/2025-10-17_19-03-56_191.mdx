[Bun 1.3: The Full-Stack JavaScript Runtime](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175802/d076523b1d "bun.sh") — Arriving a few hours after last week’s issue (natch!) Bun 1.3 remains the big news of the past week. [Bun](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175803/d076523b1d) is a performance and DX-focused JavaScriptCore-powered runtime which, with v1.3, balances being a drop-in Node.js replacement with becoming a _‘full-stack runtime’_ among other exciting developments:

*   Full‑stack dev server with [hot reloading](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175804/d076523b1d) built into `Bun.serve`
*   Improved GC with lower idle CPU and memory usage.
*   Built-in MySQL and Redis clients (alongside Postgres and SQLite).
*   The ability to [bundle both frontend and backend apps](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175805/d076523b1d) into a single build.
*   [Code signing](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175806/d076523b1d) for Windows and macOS executables you build.
*   [Isolated pnpm-esque package installs](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175807/d076523b1d) are now the default.

It also wouldn't be a big Bun release without [▶️ the obligatory release video.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/175808/d076523b1d)
