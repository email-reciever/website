[A Protracker Module Player in Pure JavaScript](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165508/d076523b1d "dittytoy.net") — I’m a sucker for 90s tracker music, JavaScript experiments, and cool Web experiences, and this has all three. If you’re not familiar with [tracker music](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165509/d076523b1d), it’s a way to write music on a grid which triggers the playing of samples. This code manages to parse and play a [Protracker](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165510/d076523b1d) file in pure JavaScript. _(Note: The image above is of the original Protracker app, this experiment is more minimal and about the code.)_

[A Protracker Module Player in Pure JavaScript](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165508/d076523b1d "dittytoy.net") — I’m a sucker for 90s tracker music, JavaScript experiments, and cool Web experiences, and this has all three. If you’re not familiar with [tracker music](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165509/d076523b1d), it’s a way to write music on a grid which triggers the playing of samples. This code manages to parse and play a [Protracker](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/165510/d076523b1d) file in pure JavaScript. *(Note: The image above is of the original Protracker app, this experiment is more minimal and about the code.)*
