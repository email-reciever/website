**IN BRIEF:**

*   [TypeScript 5.9 Beta](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171673/d076523b1d) has been released with support for [deferred module evaluation by using `import defer`.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171674/d076523b1d)
    
*   The [Nginx](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171675/d076523b1d) HTTP server has a module (`njs`) for extending its functionality using JavaScript, but it only supported ES5. Now, [`njs` uses QuickJS for a more modern, powerful experience](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171676/d076523b1d) with full ES2023 support.
    
*   Got some time to kill? There's one week left to submit an entry to [the JS1024 annual JavaScript golfing competition.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171677/d076523b1d) Create a cool JS or GLSL program in under 1024 bytes.
    
*   Oliver Stenbom reflects on [the prevalence of Rust in modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171678/d076523b1d)
    

**RELEASES:**

*   [Node.js v24.4.0 (Current)](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171680/d076523b1d) – Note that [new versions of all maintained Node.js releases](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171681/d076523b1d) are due next week due to some security vulnerabilities.
    
*   [Oxlint 1.6](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171682/d076523b1d) – Rust-powered linter for JS and TS.

[JavaScript Scope Hoisting is Broken](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171689/d076523b1d "devongovett.me") — The creator of [Parcel](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171690/d076523b1d) argues that [scope hoisting](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/171691/d076523b1d) (when bundlers inline modules into a shared scope) conflicts with modern JS patterns like code splitting and dynamic imports, causing subtle bugs and offering little benefit, so he’s considering removing it in Parcel v3.
