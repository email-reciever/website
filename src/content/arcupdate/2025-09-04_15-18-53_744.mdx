**An Exciting New Chapter**

Dear Arc Members,

[Josh](https://company.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=73c2f0478f1b3cd8343ae8f45&id=1e8bb9a1c8&e=2d91f117eb) here, with some big news we’re excited to share:   
  
**The Browser Company of New York has entered into an agreement to be acquired by Atlassian.**

From the very beginning, the Atlassian team have been among Arc’s biggest fans — their CEO [Mike](https://company.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=73c2f0478f1b3cd8343ae8f45&id=36be4c11ce&e=2d91f117eb) was actually one of our earliest bug reporters! He and the team believe in the browser’s possibilities just as deeply as you do.

But this note is really about _you._   
  
You’ve been with us from the start, too. You’ve sent feedback, shared notes with me directly, shown off your Space themes, and convinced friends to rethink the internet. Arc exists because of you, and I’ll never stop being grateful.

Here’s what this new chapter means for you:

*   **Arc and Arc Search will continue to exist; we’ll share a long-term plan soon.** The Atlassian team loves Arc and has a Slack channel with 1,000+ Arc fans!  
     
    
*   **We’re growing Dia, our AI browser.** With Atlassian’s support, we’re focused on Dia — building for more platforms, pushing the boundaries of AI browsing further, and weaving in many of the workflows you love in Arc. If you’re curious, you can try [Dia](https://company.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=73c2f0478f1b3cd8343ae8f45&id=3c917541dd&e=2d91f117eb) with your Arc email.  
     
    
*   **Same team, same way of building.** We’ll keep our NYC HQ, culture, creativity, and [heartfelt intensity](https://company.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=73c2f0478f1b3cd8343ae8f45&id=c397fb480f&e=2d91f117eb). Only difference is more support to go further, faster.
    

This is the start of a new chapter for Arc, Dia, and The Browser Company. **Thank you, thank you, thank you** for being the ones who made it possible.
